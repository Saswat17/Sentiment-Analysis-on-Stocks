Vaxzevria is estimated to have helped save over six million lives in the first year of vaccination, which reflects the strength of the evidence showing Vaxzevriaâ€™s protection against severe disease and death caused by COVID-19.â€---newarticle---                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

Vaxzevria is estimated to have helped save over six million lives in the first year of vaccination, which reflects the strength of the evidence showing Vaxzevriaâ€™s protection against severe disease and death caused by COVID-19.â€                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Vaxzevria is estimated to have helped save over six million lives in the first year of vaccination, which reflects the strength of the evidence showing Vaxzevriaâ€™s protection against severe disease and death caused by COVID-19.â€                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Vaxzevria is estimated to have helped save over six million lives in the first year of vaccination, which reflects the strength of the evidence showing Vaxzevriaâ€™s protection against severe disease and death caused by COVID-19.â€                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.\\n \\n EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.\\n \\n Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.\\n \\n A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals \"provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions\", but \"liability still remains with the companies\".\\n \\n This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.\\n \\n Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.\\n \\n The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.\\n \\n The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.\\n \\n Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.   \n",

Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.\\n \\n EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.\\n \\n Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.\\n \\n A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals \"provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions\", but \"liability still remains with the companies\".\\n \\n This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.\\n \\n Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.\\n \\n The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.\\n \\n The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.\\n \\n Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.</td>\n",

Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.\\n \\n EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.\\n \\n Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.\\n \\n A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals \"provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions\", but \"liability still remains with the companies\".\\n \\n This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.\\n \\n Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.\\n \\n The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.\\n \\n The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.\\n \\n Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.   \n",

Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.\\n \\n EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.\\n \\n Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.\\n \\n A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals \"provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions\", but \"liability still remains with the companies\".\\n \\n This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.\\n \\n Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.\\n \\n The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.\\n \\n The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.\\n \\n Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute.</td>\n",

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.</td>\n",

disappointing economic data in China took the shine off further gains in the US on Friday.\\n \\n At 9.00am the lead index was trading 11.42 points to the good at 7,512.31.\\n \\n Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said â€œEconomic news from China threatened to spoil the party after US markets staged a strong rally at the end of last week.â€\\n \\n â€œAmid geopolitical tensions as a delegation of US lawmakers arrive for a further trip to Taiwan, Chinese economic data revealed the ongoing impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and an escalating property crisis.â€\\n \\n â€œRetail sales and industrial output both rose, but by less than expected in July, alongside a disappointing showing from bank lending.â€\\n \\n But he said â€œthe UK market chose to take its lead from Wall Street, notwithstanding the fact that the Bank of England is set to maintain its aggressive interest rate stance in the face of persistent inflation in the UK.â€\\n \\n AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:NASDAQ: ) shares rose 2.1% to 10,931p as the pharmaceuticals group said that positive high-level results from a new trial of its Enhertu breast cancer drug had demonstrated a \"statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement\" in progression-free survival.\\n \\n AstraZeneca said the DESTINY-Breast02 Phase III trial on Enhertu, jointly developed and commercialised with Daiichi Sankyo, also met its key secondary endpoint of improved overall survival.\\n \\n But housebuilders, Berkeley Group Holdings PLC (LSE:BKG) (down 1.35%), Bellway (LON: ) (down 1%), Taylor Wimpey (LON: ) (down 0.5%) and Barratt Developments (LON: ) (down 0.5%) all fell following a report from Rightmove that house prices slipped in August.8.15am: Positive start to proceedings in London\\n \\n 8.15am: London upbeat in early trading\\n \\n FTSE 100 makes a positive start to trading boosted by gains in the US on Friday and despite mixed performances in Asia overnight following disappointing Chinese retail sales and industrial output figures.\\n \\n At 8.15am the lead index was trading 35.03 points higher at 7,535.92 with the broader up 47.07 points at 20.386.03.\\n \\n Latest data from online property website Rightmove showed the first fall in UK house prices this year with the average price of property coming to market down to Â£365,173 â€“ down 1.3%.\\n \\n However, Tim Bannister, Rightmoveâ€™s director of property science, says: â€œA drop in asking prices is to be expected this month after a frenzied two years and many would-be home movers become distracted by the summer holidays.â€\\n \\n â€œIndeed, for those that can, this may be their first summer holiday abroad since before the pandemic.â€\\n \\n Bannister also pointed out that price growth for the year would still be 7%.\\n \\n The number of properties currently on the market to buy is down 39% on pre-pandemic levels but despite the lack of instructions new listings rose 12% compared to the same time last year but were down 6% compared to 2019.\\n \\n Bannister also said the recent interest rate increases by the Bank of England were â€œnot having a significant impact on the number of people wanting to move.â€\\n \\n 7.30am: FTSE 100 seen higher\\n \\n London markets are expected to open higher on Monday following gains in the US on Friday and following the surprise news that China has cut a key interest rate, in a bid to boost its stuttering economy, following weaker than expected retail sales and industrial output figures.\\n \\n Investors will also have one eye on UK jobs and inflation reports due out later this week to see whether there are signs of a slowdown in the jobs market or in prices growth.\\n \\n Spread betting companies are calling the FTSE 100 up by around 35 points.\\n \\n Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said: â€œDespite the slow drip feed of negative headlines of rising gas prices, and the supply chain challenges thrown up by the heatwave in Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had on the Chinese economy, with a -2.6% contraction for Q2, although we have started to see some signs of a pick-up in economic activity, albeit from a very low base.â€\\n \\n â€œThis morningâ€™s retail sales numbers for July have confirmed how fragile this confidence still is, rising 2.7% well below expectations of 5%, and weaker than in June.â€\\n \\n â€œIndustrial production has been more robust and recovered much better, however even here economic activity disappointed in July, slipping back from 3.9% in June, to 3.8%.â€\\n \\n In London, on a quieter day for company results, Phoenix Group announced half year figures which showed strong cash generation of Â£950mln against Â£872mln in the six months to June 2021.\\n \\n The FTSE 100-listed closed book life insurer, said it was now confident of delivering at the top-end of its Â£1.3bn-to-Â£1.4bn target range for the year.\\n \\n New business long-term cash generation was a record Â£430mln in the period and more than double the first half of 2021 at Â£206mln.\\n \\n 7.00am: FTSE 100 set to open higher\\n \\n FTSE 100 set to start the week in positive fashion following gains in the US on Friday.\\n \\n Spread betting companies are calling the blue chip index up by around 32 points.\\n \\n The closed Friday up 424 points, 1.3%, at 33,761, the jumped 267 points, 2.1%, to 13,047 and the S&amp;P 500 added 73 points, 1.7%, to reach 4,280.\\n \\n The benchmarks ended the week on a high note, clinching the fourth-straight winning week for the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500.

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

(https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

(LON: ) (down 0.5%) and Barratt Developments (LON: ) (down 0.5%) all fell following a report from Rightmove that house prices slipped in August.8.15am: Positive start to proceedings in London\\n \\n 8.15am: London upbeat in early trading\\n \\n FTSE 100 makes a positive start to trading boosted by gains in the US on Friday and despite mixed performances in Asia overnight following disappointing Chinese retail sales and industrial output figures.\\n \\n At 8.15am the lead index was trading 35.03 points higher at 7,535.92 with the broader up 47.07 points at 20.386.03.\\n \\n Latest data from online property website Rightmove showed the first fall in UK house prices this year with the average price of property coming to market down to Â£365,173 â€“ down 1.3%.\\n \\n However, Tim Bannister, Rightmoveâ€™s director of property science, says: â€œA drop in asking prices is to be expected this month after a frenzied two years and many would-be home movers become distracted by the summer holidays.â€\\n \\n â€œIndeed, for those that can, this may be their first summer holiday abroad since before the pandemic.â€\\n \\n Bannister also pointed out that price growth for the year would still be 7%.\\n \\n The number of properties currently on the market to buy is down 39% on pre-pandemic levels but despite the lack of instructions new listings rose 12% compared to the same time last year but were down 6% compared to 2019.\\n \\n Bannister also said the recent interest rate increases by the Bank of England were â€œnot having a significant impact on the number of people wanting to move.â€\\n \\n 7.30am: FTSE 100 seen higher\\n \\n London markets are expected to open higher on Monday following gains in the US on Friday and following the surprise news that China has cut a key interest rate, in a bid to boost its stuttering economy, following weaker than expected retail sales and industrial output figures.\\n \\n Investors will also have one eye on UK jobs and inflation reports due out later this week to see whether there are signs of a slowdown in the jobs market or in prices growth.\\n \\n Spread betting companies are calling the FTSE 100 up by around 35 points.\\n \\n Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said: â€œDespite the slow drip feed of negative headlines of rising gas prices, and the supply chain challenges thrown up by the heatwave in Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had on the Chinese economy, with a -2.6% contraction for Q2, although we have started to see some signs of a pick-up in economic activity, albeit from a very low base.â€\\n \\n â€œThis morningâ€™s retail sales numbers for July have confirmed how fragile this confidence still is, rising 2.7% well below expectations of 5%, and weaker than in June.â€\\n \\n â€œIndustrial production has been more robust and recovered much better, however even here economic activity disappointed in July, slipping back from 3.9% in June, to 3.8%.â€\\n \\n In London, on a quieter day for company results, Phoenix Group announced half year figures which showed strong cash generation of Â£950mln against Â£872mln in the six months to June 2021.\\n \\n The FTSE 100-listed closed book life insurer, said it was now confident of delivering at the top-end of its Â£1.3bn-to-Â£1.4bn target range for the year.\\n \\n New business long-term cash generation was a record Â£430mln in the period and more than double the first half of 2021 at Â£206mln.\\n \\n 7.00am: FTSE 100 set to open higher\\n \\n FTSE 100 set to start the week in positive fashion following gains in the US on Friday.\\n \\n Spread betting

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

(https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had

sales numbers for July have confirmed how fragile this confidence still is, rising 2.7% well below expectations of 5%, and weaker than in June.â€\\n \\n â€œIndustrial production has been more robust and recovered much better, however even here economic activity disappointed in July, slipping back from 3.9% in June, to 3.8%.â€\\n \\n In London, on a quieter day for company results, Phoenix Group

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

(https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.</td>\n",

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

â€œRetail sales and industrial output both rose, but by less than expected in July, alongside a disappointing showing from bank lending.â€\\n \\n But he said â€œthe UK market chose to take its lead

Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

(https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

A divided Congress means thereâ€™s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations.\\n \\n A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term.

The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken\\n \\n GILD +1.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio\\n \\n (Reuters) - The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University, in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process.\\n \\n The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted. (https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.</td>\n",

A divided Congress means thereâ€™s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations.\\n \\n A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term. The timing of a new stimulus bill from Capitol Hill is murky, especially since the two sides could not agree on the scope and size of a plan even before the election.\\n \\n Earnings continue to roll out, giving investors a glimpse at how well -- or how not well -- companies are managing through the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1. Healthcare and drug makers in view\\n \\n Healthcare is bound to be a topic next year no matter who takes the White House, but a split Congress may make it difficult for Democrats to make much progress on expanding coverage. Meanwhile, drug prices will be under scrutiny.\\n \\n Cigna Corp (NYSE: ) shares soared 14% on Wednesday. It is expected to report earnings of $4.24 a share on revenue of $39 billion. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of $1.49 on revenue of $10 billion. AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $6.6 billion.\\n \\n 2. Gold shines on Barrick\\n \\n Gold has been a hot trade this year as investors seek a haven from a falling dollar and volatile markets. The touched a high above $2,000 this summer and has since traded back down to around $1,900, but many have an optimistic view on the next year.\\n \\n Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ), the mining company that recently attracted an investment from Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: ), is one of the companies that benefitted from rising gold prices in the most recent quarter. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to report EPS of 32 cents on revenue of $3.37 billion.\\n \\n 3. The Fed could speak on the economic outlook\\n \\n Investors await word from the Federal Open Market Committee, which held its periodic two-day meeting this week and will release a at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). Analysts expect it to hold its short term rate at 0.25%.\\n \\n Fed officials could speak on the direction of the economy and what the outlook is given the uncertainty of Covid. Several of them have spoken publicly in recent months about the need for more stimulus to support a recovery, though Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on a plan to give aid to households and businesses. 2/2 Â© Reuters.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

(https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

A divided Congress means thereâ€™s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations.\\n \\n A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term.

The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken\\n \\n GILD +1.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio\\n \\n (Reuters) - The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University, in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process.\\n \\n The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted. (https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.</td>\n",

A divided Congress means thereâ€™s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations.\\n \\n A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term. The timing of a new stimulus bill from Capitol Hill is murky, especially since the two sides could not agree on the scope and size of a plan even before the election.\\n \\n Earnings continue to roll out, giving investors a glimpse at how well -- or how not well -- companies are managing through the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1. Healthcare and drug makers in view\\n \\n Healthcare is bound to be a topic next year no matter who takes the White House, but a split Congress may make it difficult for Democrats to make much progress on expanding coverage. Meanwhile, drug prices will be under scrutiny.\\n \\n Cigna Corp (NYSE: ) shares soared 14% on Wednesday. It is expected to report earnings of $4.24 a share on revenue of $39 billion. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of $1.49 on revenue of $10 billion. AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $6.6 billion.\\n \\n 2. Gold shines on Barrick\\n \\n Gold has been a hot trade this year as investors seek a haven from a falling dollar and volatile markets. The touched a high above $2,000 this summer and has since traded back down to around $1,900, but many have an optimistic view on the next year.\\n \\n Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ), the mining company that recently attracted an investment from Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: ), is one of the companies that benefitted from rising gold prices in the most recent quarter. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to report EPS of 32 cents on revenue of $3.37 billion.\\n \\n 3. The Fed could speak on the economic outlook\\n \\n Investors await word from the Federal Open Market Committee, which held its periodic two-day meeting this week and will release a at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). Analysts expect it to hold its short term rate at 0.25%.\\n \\n Fed officials could speak on the direction of the economy and what the outlook is given the uncertainty of Covid. Several of them have spoken publicly in recent months about the need for more stimulus to support a recovery, though Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on a plan to give aid to households and businesses. 2/2 Â© Reuters.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

of markets at interactive investor, said â€œEconomic news from China threatened to spoil the party after US markets staged a strong rally at the end of last week.â€\\n \\n â€œAmid geopolitical tensions as a delegation of US lawmakers arrive for a further trip to Taiwan, Chinese economic data revealed the ongoing impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and an escalating property crisis.â€\\n \\n â€œRetail sales and industrial output both rose, but by less than expected in July, alongside a disappointing showing from bank lending.â€\\n \\n But he said â€œthe UK market chose to take its lead from Wall Street, notwithstanding the fact that the Bank of England is set to maintain its aggressive interest rate stance in the face of persistent inflation in the UK.â€\\n \\n AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:NASDAQ: ) shares rose 2.1% to 10,931p as the pharmaceuticals group said that positive high-level results from a new trial of its Enhertu breast cancer drug had demonstrated a \"statistically

Rightmoveâ€™s director of property science, says: â€œA drop in asking prices is to be expected this month after a frenzied two years and many would-be home movers become distracted by the summer

\\n Michael Hewson chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said: â€œDespite the slow drip feed of negative headlines of rising gas prices, and the supply chain challenges thrown up by the heatwave in Europe, thereâ€™s been little appetite to drive stocks lower in recent weeks.â€\\n \\n â€œAsia markets have got off to a positive start to the week, with the latest retail sales and industrial production numbers for China showing an economy that still appears low on confidence when it comes to consumer spending, and economic activity more broadly.â€\\n \\n â€œThis weakness in the Chinese economy comes against the struggle to adapt to a zero-covid policy, which the government shows little sign of relaxing, against a backdrop of rising cases.â€\\n \\n â€œProblems in the property sector also arenâ€™t helping, where many home buyers are halting mortgage payments in protest at delays to the completion of new homes.â€\\n \\n â€œIn June we saw the effects the zero-covid policy has had on the Chinese economy, with a -2.6% contraction for Q2, although we have started to see some signs of a pick-up in economic activity, albeit from a very low base.â€\\n \\n â€œThis morningâ€™s retail sales numbers for July have confirmed how fragile this confidence still is, rising 2.7% well below expectations of 5%, and weaker than in June.â€\\n \\n â€œIndustrial production has been more robust and recovered much better, however even here economic activity disappointed in July, slipping back from 3.9% in June, to 3.8%.â€\\n \\n In London, on a quieter day for company results, Phoenix Group announced half year figures which showed strong cash generation of Â£950mln against Â£872mln in the six months to June 2021.\\n \\n The FTSE 100-listed closed book life insurer, said it was now confident of delivering at the top-end of its Â£1.3bn-to-Â£1.4bn target range for the year.\\n \\n New business long-term cash generation was a record Â£430mln in the period and more than double the

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken\\n \\n GILD +1.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio\\n \\n (Reuters) - The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University, in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process.\\n \\n The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted. (https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.</td>\n",

A divided Congress means thereâ€™s less likelihood Democrats can push through a big spending bill, as well as raise taxes and hike regulations.\\n \\n A contested election for the White House is adding uncertainty to the near-term. The timing of a new stimulus bill from Capitol Hill is murky, especially since the two sides could not agree on the scope and size of a plan even before the election.\\n \\n Earnings continue to roll out, giving investors a glimpse at how well -- or how not well -- companies are managing through the economic recovery. The Federal Reserve is also expected to opine on rates on Thursday.\\n \\n Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:\\n \\n 1. Healthcare and drug makers in view\\n \\n Healthcare is bound to be a topic next year no matter who takes the White House, but a split Congress may make it difficult for Democrats to make much progress on expanding coverage. Meanwhile, drug prices will be under scrutiny.\\n \\n Cigna Corp (NYSE: ) shares soared 14% on Wednesday. It is expected to report earnings of $4.24 a share on revenue of $39 billion. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of $1.49 on revenue of $10 billion. AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ), up 6%, is seen reporting EPS of 50 cents on revenue of $6.6 billion.\\n \\n 2. Gold shines on Barrick\\n \\n Gold has been a hot trade this year as investors seek a haven from a falling dollar and volatile markets. The touched a high above $2,000 this summer and has since traded back down to around $1,900, but many have an optimistic view on the next year.\\n \\n Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ), the mining company that recently attracted an investment from Warren Buffettâ€™s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: ), is one of the companies that benefitted from rising gold prices in the most recent quarter. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect it to report EPS of 32 cents on revenue of $3.37 billion.\\n \\n 3. The Fed could speak on the economic outlook\\n \\n Investors await word from the Federal Open Market Committee, which held its periodic two-day meeting this week and will release a at 2:00 PM ET (1800 GMT). Analysts expect it to hold its short term rate at 0.25%.\\n \\n Fed officials could speak on the direction of the economy and what the outlook is given the uncertainty of Covid. Several of them have spoken publicly in recent months about the need for more stimulus to support a recovery, though Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on a plan to give aid to households and businesses. 2/2 Â© Reuters.

AstraZeneca is presenting its third quarter financial results on Thursday.\\n \\n 'GAME CHANGER'\\n \\n Work on the Oxford viral vector vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, began in January. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees.\\n \\n The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells. The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it again.\\n \\n If Oxford's vaccine works, it could eventually allow the world to return to some measure of normality.\\n \\n Asked what success looked like, Pollard said: \"Good is having vaccines that have significant efficacy - so whether, I mean, that is 50, 60, 70, 80 percent, whatever the figure is - is an enormous achievement.\\n \\n \"It's a complete game changer and a success if we meet those efficacy end points,\" he said, adding it would relieve pressure on the health system.\\n \\n But Pollard and Bingham agreed that the world would not return to normal immediately. Asked about the chances of a vaccine that would wipe out the coronavirus next year, Bingham said the prospects were \"very slim\".\\n \\n \"(But the chances) to get a vaccine that has an effect of both reducing illness, and reducing mortality (are) very high,\" Bingham said, adding she was more than 50% confident there would be such a vaccine by early summer.

J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.\\n \\n Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.\\n \\n Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\n \"As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,\" said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.\\n \\n Infections are rising in 80 countries (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/index.html) as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.\\n \\n J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.\\n \\n J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.\\n \\n J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.\\n \\n So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.\\n \\n AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.\\n \\n AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.\\n \\n Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine is being developed along with researchers at Oxford University.   \n",

They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.\\n \\n The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.\\n \\n Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.\\n \\n The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.\\n \\n MIXED RESULTS\\n \\n While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs.\\n \\n On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.\\n \\n For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion (5 billion pounds) were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.\\n \\n However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents.\\n \\n Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.\\n \\n The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.\\n \\n Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.\\n \\n Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\n \"As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,\" said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.\\n \\n Infections are rising in 80 countries (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/index.html) as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.\\n \\n J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.\\n \\n J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.\\n \\n J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.\\n \\n So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.\\n \\n AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.\\n \\n AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.\\n \\n Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.\\n \\n

In a recent Twitter... AstraZeneca PLC said Wednesday that Capivasertib plus Faslodex significantly improved progression-free survival when compared with Faslodex combined with a placebo in a Phase 3 trial in advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\\n \\n The Anglo-Swedish pharma giant AZN, +1.77% AZN, +0.56% said the trial met both primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival in the overall patient population and in a prespecified biomarker subgroup of patients whose tumors had qualifying alterations.

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken\\n \\n GILD +1.11% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio\\n \\n (Reuters) - The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University, in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process.\\n \\n The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted. (https://\\n \\n The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.\\n \\n U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n \"This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,\" the watchdog said.\\n \\n Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.\\n \\n The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.\\n \\n The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.</td>\n",

FILE PHOTO: The company logo for pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is displayed on a screen on the floor at the NYSE in New York 2/2\\n \\n AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio\\n \\n By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger\\n \\n (Reuters) - A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government.\\n \\n Britain's vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year, against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept. 30.\\n \\n AstraZeneca (L: ) said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies.\\n \\n It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers, and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval.\\n \\n \"We are a little bit late in deliveries, which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form,\" CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call.\\n \\n However, he added AstraZeneca was \"fully\" prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready, adding the company's weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans.\\n \\n AstraZeneca and its partner on the project, the University of Oxford, said data from late-stage trials should land this year. If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.\\n \\n The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.\\n \\n Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.\\n \\n The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.\\n \\n MIXED RESULTS\\n \\n While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs.\\n \\n On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.\\n \\n For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion (5 billion pounds) were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.\\n \\n However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents.\\n \\n Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.\\n \\n The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.</td>\n",

            " \n",
            " AstraZeneca's large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company's UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\n",
            " \n",
            " The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said.\n",
            " \n",
            " An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.\n",
            " \n",
            " The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources.\n",
            " \n",
            " UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was â€œinsufficient evidence to say for certainâ€ that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters.\n",
            " \n",
            " â€œIn this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,â€ the draft consent form stated. â€œClose monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.â€\n",
            " \n",
            " Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there.\n",
            " \n",
            " AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from Pfizer Inc (N: ) and Moderna Inc (O: ) are expected some time next month.\n",
            " \n",
            " Johnson & Johnson (N: ) last week paused its Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial to investigate an unexplained illness in a study participant. At the time of the announcement, the company did not know whether the volunteer had been given its vaccine or a placebo.\n",
            " \n",
            " A J&J spokesman on Tuesday said the study remains on pause as the company continues its review of medical information before deciding to restart the trial.

            " \n",
            " Responding to a request about the AstraZeneca trial, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had â€œcompleted their analysisâ€ and said vaccination under the study in the United States would resume shortly.\n",
            " \n",

            " The Health Research Authority, which helps oversee UK medical research, said in an email to Reuters that it vetted the communication to make sure it was suitable to ensure informed consent among study volunteers. It could not confirm that the letter had been issued.\n",
            " \n",
            " An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it \"cannot verify the content,\" referring to the draft letter to study participants.\n",

            " Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes.\n",
            " \n",
            " Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals.\n",

Thatâ€™s more cases than any other nation, including India, which has a population four times that of the U.S. It is true that the U.S. hasnâ€™t had the most deaths per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Missteps in handling the virus include advising the public initially not to wear masks, advising those who donâ€™t exhibit symptoms to not get tested and continued shortages of supplies and testing backlogs. Seven months into the pandemic, the U.S. has still not streamlined its testing efforts as have countries praised for their virus response including South Korea and Germany.\n",

            " The fact is that the company is a global powerhouse for oncology drugs and others that treat chronic diseases of the lungs and kidneys. It earns gross margins of 80% in a normal year and it expects its underlying earnings per share to grow by between 15% and 20% in 2020, a year when the worldâ€™s healthcare systems have had trouble finding resources for anything but treating Covid-19.\n",
            " \n",
            " It is, beyond any reasonable doubt, a well-run company, whose shares deserve a management premium. In barely seven years as CEO, Pascal Soriot had raised the market value of an already mature business by 150% when the pandemic erupted. Soriot has quickly addressed this weekâ€™s misstep over communicating stage 2 trial results by ordering a new trial, as any responsible CEO might.\n",
            " \n",
            " Global regulators have been pleased to approve a string of its drugs in recent years, and suggestions that this vital relationship will be damaged by an imperfect trial conducted under the extraordinary pressures of the current race for a Covid cure are alarmist.\n",
            " \n",
            " Barring a fiasco wholly out of character with the rest of Soriotâ€™s career, there is no downside risk for the share price even if the Covid-19 drug falls short. AstraZenecaâ€™s share price is almost exactly where it was at the start of the year, before anyone had even heard the dreaded C-word. Given that the cost of servicing its sizable debt pile has come down sharply since then (allowing a higher stock valuation, all other things being equal), you can even argue that the market is already applying a discount to the shares for the whole Covid-19 saga.\n",
            " \n",
            " Either the drug is a write-off, in which case much of the cost remains with the governments that have helped to fund its development, or it actually is effective, allowing worldwide distribution. In the latter case, the fact that it has agreed to provide the drug at no profit should not be seen as the bugbear that many investors consider it. Reports citing confidential contracts with manufacturers suggest that AZ will be able to exercise pricing power from the second half of next year already.\n",
            " \n",
            " And if it does eschew the short-term profit by keeping the price down, the long-term benefit could still be considerable. Cancer, its true specialism, is a rich country disease, so the spread of wealth across ever more parts of the world is a secular positive for it. The gain in goodwill from not price-gouging on the drug everyone wants and needs will be intangible, but immeasurable.\n",

            " LONDON (Reuters) - So why did I volunteer to be injected with an experimental vaccine for COVID-19? That's what some of my friends wanted to know when I told them what I was doing.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"Who knows about the long term,\" texted a former college roommate. \"Seems like a gamble.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " It all began in July when the British government announced it was seeking lots of volunteers for large-scale clinical trials of new vaccines. Only a month before, a good friend of mine here had died of COVID-19 after spending weeks on a ventilator.\n",
            " \n",
            " Curious, I completed an online form, figuring I wasn't committing myself to anything.\n",
            " \n",
            " In late September, an email informed me that I was among more than 250,000 \"pioneers in the fight against COVID-19\" who had enlisted in the cause. On Oct. 1, I was invited to apply for a trial of a vaccine made by an American biotech company called Novavax Inc (O: ). It was seeking at the time up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom for a late-stage trial to determine the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"If you are aged 18-84 and in good health, you could be eligible to participate,\" the email stated. \"The study involves six visits over a period of around 13 months. Reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " Now, it was time to decide. I began researching the Novavax vaccine, which has received less attention than several others. On Monday, Pfizer Inc (N: ) announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appeared to be more than 90% effective. In September, late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) were halted after a report of a serious neurological illness in a volunteer, although the trials later were permitted to resume.\n",
            " \n",
            " To me, the Novavax vaccine seemed less risky. Although the Maryland-based company has never received approval for a vaccine, it's employing the same technology to create its COVID-19 candidate that it used with a promising flu shot. I've gotten inoculated against the flu every year for decades and never once had an adverse reaction.\n",
            " \n",
            " The published results of the first phase of testing the Novavax vaccine also showed no serious side effects among more than 100 participants who were injected with it. The worst case was someone who had a mild fever for a day.\n",
            " \n",
            " I decided to go for it. I figured if life is ever going to return to normal, the world is going to need vaccines and volunteers to see if they work. On a selfish level, I liked the idea of getting inoculated as soon as possible, given how monotonous â€“ and sometimes scary â€“ my daily routine had become. I've become so risk-averse that my wife has called me her \"jailer.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " Another attraction: If I were to catch the virus, the researchers would carefully monitor me. In the UK, where there has been a surge in new COVID-19 cases to more than 20,000 a day, infected people essentially are on their own unless they require emergency care.\n",
            " \n",
            " Of course, there was a 50-50 chance I would be injected with a placebo â€“ a saline solution â€“ that wouldn't protect me against anything. In testing vaccines, placebos are used as a control to see whether the real thing is more effective at fending off the virus.\n",
            " \n",
            " And so, after an online and over-the-phone screening to determine if I had any medical conditions that disqualified me from the study, I was given an appointment for the first of two injections.\n",
            " \n",
            " I showed up one recent morning at the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London â€“ a small, drab building that is part of a sprawling medical complex. To my surprise, the receptionist asked me to take off my \"Churchill Pro\" bike mask â€“ which costs $33 and uses \"British Military Filtration Technology\" to block \"almost 100%\" of viruses â€“ and replace it with a cheap, disposable one. I later learned this was because my super-duper mask potentially could be contaminated.\n",
            " \n",
            " Several other volunteers were already in a large room getting set up. I met privately with a doctor who asked if I had any questions. I had a few: \"What if the Novavax vaccine proved so successful that the trial was stopped? Would I be told whether I received the placebo and, if so, be given the real vaccine?\" The doctor told me that if I had gotten the placebo, I would have to wait a year, since the researchers would want to keep monitoring every trial participant. Not what I wanted to hear.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"What if another vaccine is approved first and I was given the placebo? Would I be allowed to take that?\" The doctor suggested that was possible.\n",
            " \n",
            " After I signed a consent form to participate in the trial, she gave me a brief physical exam. Back in the large room, a nurse gave me a COVID-19 test, sticking a long swab up my throat and then through a nostril. Then he prepared to draw my blood. I warned him my veins were thin and often proved problematic. He proceeded to fail twice before calling over a colleague who had better luck.\n",
            " \n",
            " The injection itself was uneventful. But when the nurse checked my blood pressure afterward, it had spiked. He asked me to wait a few minutes and basically calm down. I thought about the meditation exercises I had always scoffed at but had recently tried to reduce pandemic-induced anxiety â€“ breathe in, breathe out. It worked.\n",
            " \n",
            " So far, I've experienced no side effects and am awaiting a second injection once three weeks have passed. Curious about my experience, I spoke to James Galloway, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College who is the doctor responsible for my trial.\n",
            " \n",
            " He told me that no decisions have been made on what to do with volunteers who received the placebo if Novavax is shown to be effective or another vaccine is approved first. He later added, \"If we get another vaccine that works, we'd want people to get that vaccine if they've had the placebo.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " \"We don't want anyone to suffer from participating in the study,\" he said.\n",
            " \n",
            " A spokeswoman for Novavax later told me volunteers would discuss their options with the clinicians overseeing the trial sites.\n",
            " \n",
            " Galloway said there's a theoretical risk if someone who got the Novavax vaccine is injected with a different one. \"There's a chance you'd have a reaction.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " He doesn't know how the UK Novavax trial is going so far because he doesn't have access to the data. But overall, he remains optimistic that effective vaccines against COVID-19 will arrive.\n",
            " \n",
            " As it happens, the 42-year-old doctor contracted COVID-19 himself last spring. He said he had a fever for 10 days and was briefly hospitalized after developing a heart rhythm problem. \"I wouldn't wish it on anyone,\" he said.\n",

            " \"It is vastly too early to be dismissing this vaccine,\" said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation that co-leads the global COVAX programme to provide vaccine doses in poor countries.\n",
            " \n",

            " If the vaccine does not work well against new evolving variants of the virus, it could be an ominous sign for other vaccines as well, showing that the virus can potentially thwart the efforts of scientists to fight it.\n",
            " \n",
            " The overall message from the World Health Organization and others was: don't panic. Several global health officials noted that the South African study was small and had tested the vaccine using a short four-week interval between the first and second doses, despite evidence having since emerged that it works better if there is a longer wait.\n",

            " \"We think that both the vaccines that we're currently using are effective in, as I say, in stopping serious disease and death,\" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters. Britain is also using Pfizer (NYSE: )'s vaccine.\n",

A revised offer, which incorporates two Scheme options, was submitted to the Independent Customer Committee on 12 November. The Board's view is that a Scheme that is contingent on a continuing business will provide creditors with more value and a more certain outcome. Neither of the proposed Schemes is expected to satisfy the liability owed to redress creditors with valid claims in full, but the contribution to the new Scheme will be significantly increased. Without an approved Scheme, Amigo expects to have to file for administration or other insolvency process.\n",

            " \n",
            " Nearly two years into a pandemic that has already killed more than 5 million people, only about 7% of people in low-income countries have received a dose. Vaccine deliveries worldwide have been delayed by production problems, hoarding by rich countries, export restrictions and red tape. Many programmes have also been hampered by hesitancy among the public.\n",
            " \n",
            " The legal concerns are an additional hurdle for public health officials tackling the coronavirus â€“ even as officials say unvaccinated people offer an ideal environment for it to mutate into new variants that threaten hard-won immunity around the world. Many COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers have required that countries indemnify them for any adverse events suffered by individuals as a result of the vaccines, the United Nations says.\n",
            " \n",
            " Where governments are not in control, that is not possible.\n",
            " \n",
            " The concerns affect people, such as those displaced by the Myanmar, Afghanistan and Ethiopian crises, who are beyond the reach of national governments' vaccination schemes.\n",
            " \n",
            " For refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers, as well as people afflicted by natural disasters or other events that put them out of reach of government help, the global programme known as COVAX created a Humanitarian Buffer â€“ a last-resort reserve of shots to be administered by humanitarian groups. Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is a public-private partnership set up in 2000 to promote vaccination around the world.\n",
            " \n",
            " But that buffer does not have any mechanism to offer compensation. Gavi, which operates COVAX with the World Health Organization (WHO), says that where those applying for doses, mainly NGOs, can't bear legal risks, deliveries from that stockpile can only be made if vaccine-makers accept liability.\n",
            " \n",
            " The companies that are willing to do so under these circumstances provide only a minority of the programme's vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter and the documents, written by Gavi staff for a board meeting starting at the end of November.\n",
            " \n",
            " More than two-thirds of COVAX doses have come from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) and its partner BioNTech SE, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) PLC and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Gavi says. Moderna declined to comment. AstraZeneca and Pfizer said they were in talks with Gavi but declined to comment further. All three said they are committed to making doses available to poorer nations at relatively low prices. Pfizer said it was collaborating directly with governments in Jordan and Lebanon to donate doses for refugees.\n",
            " \n",
            " Mainly because of the legal concerns, less than 2 million doses have so far been sent from the buffer, Gavi says. About 167 million people risk being excluded from national programmes, according to United Nations data cited in the documents.\n",
            " \n",
            " Unless all the firms accept legal liability, \"access to vaccines for some populations will remain a challenge,\" the Gavi documents say, adding that new crises will generate additional demand to cover displaced populations.\n",
            " \n",
            " The vaccine makers' reluctance to take on the legal risks is \"a major hurdle\" in attempts to provide vaccines for the buffer, a spokesperson for Gavi told Reuters. Gavi did not comment on the details in the documents, but said applications for vaccines are confidential until the doses are delivered. In September, Gavi's CEO, Seth Berkley, tweeted an appeal to drugmakers to waive their requirements for legal indemnity.\n",

            " Three Chinese drugmakers have agreed to shoulder legal risks when their shots are delivered through the buffer: SinoVac Biotech Ltd, Sinopharm Group Co.

            " Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) of the United States confirmed it would waive a requirement for indemnity for deliveries from the buffer: \"We are proud to be part of this effort to protect the world's most vulnerable people,\" said Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer. He did not elaborate.\n",
            " \n",
            " However, less than one-third of COVAX supplies have come from these four firms, COVAX data shows: Clover's shot has not yet been approved so is not in use.\n",
            " \n",
            " The global industry association, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), said \"no company has refused to consider\" taking on the legal risk. However, in the case of shots delivered from the buffer, it said some firms felt they could not do so without full knowledge of where and how vaccines would be used.\n",
            " \n",
            " It would be hard to continuously monitor vaccines for safety in refugee camps, and delivery is logistically very challenging and not suitable for all types, said the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which represents large pharmaceutical companies in Europe.\n",
            " \n",
            " People may blame vaccines for problems that emerge afterwards even if they are unrelated, it said.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"This could then lead to an increased number of litigation cases ... during which the safety and efficacy of the vaccine would be publicly questioned,\" it said in a statement to Reuters. That might lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and a slower recovery from the pandemic, it said.\n",
            " \n",
            " So far there is scant information on COVID vaccine litigation, but claims made to out-of-court compensation programmes are one measure of the risk. A programme in the United States has so far not paid out anything, public data show; neither has one set up by the WHO for lower income countries, the WHO said. In Europe, a handful of compensation awards have been granted for undisclosed amounts of money, official data from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Switzerland show.\n",
            " \n",
            " Globally there have been few reported COVID infections among refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers â€“ testing is not always systematic and infections can generate only mild symptoms especially in younger people.\n",
            " \n",
            " But cramped conditions and weak healthcare expose them to high infection risk. This, combined with low levels of vaccination in a mobile population could favour the emergence of new variants and be a vector for infection, said Mireille Lembwadio, Global Vaccination Coordinator at the International Organization of Migration (IOM), a U.N.-related body that advises governments and migrants.\n",

            " WAITING FOR DOSES\n",
            " \n",
            " Francois Nosten, a French professor who helps coordinate healthcare for people from Myanmar living on the border with Thailand, is one of those waiting for vaccines. In June, he put in a request from the Humanitarian Buffer for 70,000 doses â€“ some for some of the 90,000 or so who are sheltering in camps along the border, but most for unregistered migrants in the border town of Mae Sot and nearby villages.\n",
            " \n",
            " Nosten, whose main work is researching malaria, is expecting the doses - a fraction of the more than 8 billion administered worldwide - this month. He has been told they will come from Sinopharm, and he hopes they can help inoculate key at-risk groups in Thailand's Tak province. Gavi said delivery arrangements are still being finalised.\n",
            " \n",
            " About 20,000 doses will be given to people in the camps by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a humanitarian group working with Nosten.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"At this point whatever vaccine we can secure we are grateful for,\" said its Thailand Director, Darren Hertz. He added that the IRC believed the likelihood that a member of the refugee population would attempt to take legal action in case of side-effects was \"extremely low.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " Hertz said the IRC has received a handful of ad hoc vaccine donations from the Thai government and is currently tackling significant outbreaks in five of nine camps on the border, where about 3,000 cases have been confirmed, including at least 26 deaths. A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed the government was working with the IRC on providing vaccinations in shelters along the border.\n",
            " \n",
            " Nosten's charity, Border Health Foundation (BHF), is one of eight organisations worldwide that have applied to distribute the shots from the Humanitarian Buffer and one of three to be approved, Gavi said.\n",
            " \n",
            " Ann Burton, Chief of Public Health at the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said the liability issue was one reason agencies have been slow to apply. The programme has also been delayed by the general shortage of vaccines and administrative hurdles.\n",
            " \n",
            " Organisations applying for supplies from the buffer may not choose which vaccines they receive. Working with displaced people, Nosten said it would be more convenient to give them Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which offers protection after a single dose instead of the two doses needed for Sinopharm's.\n",
            " \n",
            " But the Sinopharm version will be \"better than nothing,\" he said.\n",
            " \n",
            " More than 100 national governments have promised to offer vaccines where possible to all the displaced people on their soil, according to the IOM. However, the U.N. group says migrants and refugees are often effectively excluded from such schemes because of administrative or cultural hurdles.\n",
            " \n",
            " In cases where governments aren't in charge or have not agreed to vaccinate migrants, COVAX's Humanitarian Buffer is the only option. At least 40 countries have yet to include unauthorised migrants in their vaccination programmes, according to the IOM â€“ it and the UNHCR declined to name the countries.\n",
            " \n",
            " Gavi set up the buffer in March 2021, planning to reserve up to 5% of vaccine doses as they become available to COVAX, which would amount to roughly 70 million doses so far.\n",
            " \n",
            " The only shots delivered from the buffer so far - just over 1.6 million Sinopharm doses â€“ landed in Iran in November, where high numbers of displaced Afghans have arrived, UNICEF Iran said. That's enough to inoculate about 800,000 people; more will likely be needed, UNICEF said.\n",
            " \n",
            " NEED FOR SPEED\n",
            " \n",
            " The vaccine makers' legal concern is rooted in the unprecedented speed of the effort to develop the COVID shots, the EFPIA said.\n",
            " \n",
            " In normal circumstances, drugmakers buy insurance to cover liability for vaccines' potential adverse effects. But COVID forced them to develop drugs so quickly that some side effects - for instance, a rare blood-clotting condition in some of those who took the AstraZeneca vaccine - are emerging as shots go into people's arms.\n",
            " \n",
            " Many governments and international agencies have set up compensation schemes to reimburse victims and avoid lengthy litigation. An emergency law invoked by the U.S. government provides legal immunity for drug companies for side effects from their COVID-19 vaccines used in the country. The only exception is for instances of \"wilful misconduct.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " For drug companies, accepting potential liability runs counter to standard practice.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"Vaccine manufacturers try to minimize legal risks in almost every setting,\" said John T. Monahan, Professor at Georgetown University. \"The gold standard is full immunity from lawsuits. If they accept carve-outs, it may become more difficult to reach that goal.\"\n",

            " BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The relatively short shelf life of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine is complicating the rollout to the world's poorest nations, according to officials and internal World Health Organization documents reviewed by Reuters.\n",
            " \n",
            " It is the latest headache to plague the COVAX vaccine-sharing project, co-led by the WHO and aimed at getting shots to the world's neediest people.\n",
            " \n",
            " Initially, poorer countries and COVAX lagged richer countries in securing vaccine supplies, as wealthier nations used their financial might to acquire the first available doses.\n",
            " \n",
            " As vaccine production ramped up and richer states began donating excess doses, some countries - particularly in Africa â€“ are now struggling to administer the big shipments.\n",
            " \n",
            " The need to turn down vaccines with short shelf lives, along with the initial inequality, hesitancy and other barriers, has contributed to a much lower vaccination rate in Africa where only around 10% of people have been immunised, compared with more than 70% in richer nations.\n",
            " \n",
            " Many vaccines are arriving with only a few months, and sometimes weeks, before their use-by date, adding to the scramble to get shots in arms. Some countries have had to destroy expired doses, including Nigeria which dumped up to 1 million AstraZeneca vaccines in November.\n",
            " \n",
            " The problem with a short shelf life largely concerns AstraZeneca, according to COVAX data and officials.\n",
            " \n",
            " An internal WHO document reviewed by Reuters detailing vaccine stocks in several central and west African countries for the week ending Feb. 6 highlighted the problem.\n",
            " \n",
            " Most of the 19 listed African nations had expired AstraZeneca doses, compared to a handful of countries with expired doses from other manufacturers. Of the total expired doses declared by those countries in the week, about 1.3 million were AstraZeneca, 280,000 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), 15,000 Moderna (NASDAQ: ) and 13,000 Russia's Sputnik, the document shows.\n",
            " \n",
            " Many more vaccines are expected to be rejected as African nations and COVAX said that from January they would not accept vaccines with less than two-and-a-half months' shelf life.\n",
            " \n",
            " Yet Benin received 80,400 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX on Jan. 30, set to expire on Feb. 28. It also got 100,000 doses of the Sputnik Light vaccine from Russia, with the same expiry date - but outside the COVAX initiative. Vaccines from other manufacturers had a much longer shelf life, according to the document.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"Since January 2022, COVAX is shipping vaccines to countries on demand, ensuring that countries get the right volume at the right time,\" said Phiona Atuhebwe, a vaccine expert at WHO Africa.\n",
            " \n",
            " Asked about the internal document, seen by Reuters, she said: \"WHO is fully cognizant of the pressure that short shelf life doses put on delivery strategies and systems amid weak infrastructure and low demand.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " Two and a half months of shelf life is the minimum duration African countries reckon they need to administer the shots.\n",
            " \n",
            " AstraZeneca, COVAX's second-biggest supplier after Pfizer (NYSE: ), said that since the start of the global rollout, more than 250 million of its shots left factories with less than two-and-a-half months before expiry.\n",
            " \n",
            " Short shelf life is not generally a problem for a wealthy country with expertise and infrastructure. But without systems in place, it can be insurmountable.\n",
            " \n",
            " A spokesperson for Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca said vaccines had to undergo scrupulous quality checks and pointed to the fact that the company was a major player in supporting vaccination drives in poorer nations. With donations from rich countries included, more AstraZeneca vaccines have been distributed by COVAX than any other shot.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"AstraZeneca has supplied 2.6 billion vaccine doses globally, approximately two thirds of which have gone to low and lower middle-income countries,\" the spokesperson said.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"Almost nine out of 10 doses released from our manufacturing sites ready for donation have a shelf life of at least two and a half months which is consistent with the rest of our supply chains,\" the spokesperson added.\n",
            " \n",
            " CLOCK TICKING\n",
            " \n",
            " The volumes of delivered vaccines vastly outnumber wasted doses, but the losses have been substantial thanks in part to the time pressures. This has led to AstraZeneca shots being turned down even before being shipped.\n",
            " \n",
            " Taking into account only donated doses, which represent nearly half the billion vaccines distributed by COVAX, about 30 million AstraZeneca shots were rejected or deferred last year by poor nations, said Gavi, the nonprofit that co-runs COVAX alongside the WHO. That amounts to a quarter of AstraZeneca's donated shots via COVAX.\n",
            " \n",
            " Many were later re-assigned to other countries, Gavi added, noting that more than 95% of them were AstraZeneca. It did not say where to.\n",
            " \n",
            " Millions of additional AstraZeneca doses shared by the EU, COVAX's biggest donor, have not been distributed yet, according to an EU internal document reviewed by Reuters.\n",
            " \n",
            " The main problem is the vaccine's shelf life of just six months from the date of bottling, the shortest among COVAX's top suppliers, several COVAX and EU officials told Reuters.\n",
            " \n",
            " In addition, the company's quality checks can themselves sometimes take months.\n",
            " \n",
            " COVAX's complex system to assign doses to countries, and donors' requests to deliver them to selected nations, often further eat into the vaccine's short life, leaving sometimes only a few weeks before they expire.\n",
            " \n",
            " Quality checks are conducted by all vaccine makers, but the time constraints are less of an issue for COVAX's other top suppliers. Johnson & Johnson's vaccines last two years when frozen, Pfizer's last nine months and Moderna's seven months, according to storage instructions approved by the WHO.\n",
            " \n",
            " Millions of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could also go wasted, some African countries warned in the WHO document, with the problem being linked usually to low vaccine uptake and insufficient cold-chain equipment to distribute these shots in remote regions.\n",
            " \n",
            " EXTENDING SHELF LIFE\n",
            " \n",
            " Gavi said it has encouraged AstraZeneca to apply to the WHO for an extension of the expiration date, but talks have not led yet to a formal application. AstraZeneca said the process is complex due to its vast global network of companies manufacturing its vaccine.\n",
            " \n",
            " One of its production partners, the Serum Institute of India, has been granted WHO approval for a nine-month shelf life, after it was initially authorised only for six. But other batches produced by AstraZeneca in the rest of the world have only six.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"We are currently in discussions with the World Health Organisation ... but this is a complex task which requires data to be collected from across our global manufacturing network,\" a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said.\n",

            " A WHO spokesperson did not comment on the talks.\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",

            " (Reuters) -AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine still has a role to play in the fight against the pandemic, even as sales slow and the company charges more in some places, CEO Pascal Soriot said on Friday, the latest drugmaker to warn about a global supply glut.\n",
            " \n",
            " The comments come after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and sales driven by the vaccine, its second bestseller last year raking in $3.9 billion. It also confirmed its forecast that 2022 sales of the shot would fall.\n",
            " \n",
            " The vaccine, branded as Vaxzevria and Covishield, has struggled to compete with rivals made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) using mRNA technology, and has hit setbacks with production, rare side-effects and relatively limited shelf life. Approval in the United States has been delayed.\n",
            " \n",
            " Soriot said the shot, which was seen early in the pandemic as the inoculation of choice for low-income countries, should remain relevant because it's easy to administer and distribute.\n",
            " \n",
            " Volume will ease, though, because people will probably only need one booster.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"We are no longer in a period of scarcity of vaccine supply - we have oversupply everywhere around the world. So what is out there needs to be used and then of course we'll be able to get a better sense for reordering,\" he said on a media call.\n",
            " \n",
            " Rival Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) this month pulled its sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine, blaming oversupply on hesitancy in developing countries.\n",
            " \n",
            " So far, 2.9 billion shots of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccine have been delivered globally.\n",
            " \n",
            " In the first quarter, the company recorded $1.15 billion in sales for the product, the majority of which came from initial contracts, but that number eclipsed analysts' consensus forecast of $739 million, cited by Credit Suisse (SIX: ).\n",
            " \n",
            " AstraZeneca's shares were down 0.6% in early afternoon trading, underperfoming London's blue-chip index.\n",
            " \n",
            " The company has started earning a modest profit on the vaccine, which was initially sold at-cost, but it will continue selling in low-income countries on a non-profit basis.\n",
            " \n",
            " Apart from the vaccine, AstraZeneca also has a COVID-19 treatment, Evusheld, which has been authorised in many regions including the United States, United Kingdom and European Union for preventing infections in people whose immune system is too weak to respond to vaccines.\n",
            " \n",
            " The drug generated $469 million in first-quarter revenue, below the consensus forecast of $480 million, cited by Credit Suisse.\n",
            " \n",
            " Access to the drug in the United States has been limited by logistical bottlenecks that are being addressed, Soriot said, adding Britain was one of the few developed countries that has not ordered Evusheld.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"It's a sad situation, quite frankly, because people who are immunocompromised are really suffering from the COVID crisis.\"\n",

            " \n",
            " Even though COVID-19 levels are beginning to wane, access to cancer diagnoses and treatment has still not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Things should normalise over the next few months, Soriot predicted.\n",
            " \n",
            " Meanwhile, the company pared back its expectations for China, which accounted for about 16% of total revenue last year.\n",
            " \n",
            " The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it expected sales there to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2022, largely due to the impact of a programme designed to bring down the prices of off-patent drugs in the country.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"The future for China, we believe is still very strong and we expect to return to growth in the next couple of years,\" Soriot said, cautioning that lockdowns in China this year could hurt the uptake of cancer and other drugs.\n",

            " LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and Daiichi Sankyo's Enhertu extended survival by more than six months in patients with a form of advanced breast cancer compared to standard chemotherapy, according to data presented on Sunday.\n",
            " \n",
            " The data, unveiled at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, could open a large, new multibillion-dollar patient population for the drug that won U.S. approval in late 2019 as a third-line treatment for the 15% of breast cancer patients with HER2-positive disease.\n",
            " \n",
            " The ongoing phase III trial involves over 550 patients with so-called HER2-low breast cancer - most with tumours that were hormone-sensitive - whose disease had spread and had undergone at least one round of chemotherapy.\n",
            " \n",
            " The interim analysis showed Enhertu prolonged survival by an additional 6.4 months in patients with hormone-sensitive tumours. Patients in the group lived for a median of 23.9 months versus 17.5 months for chemotherapy.\n",
            " \n",
            " In the small group of patients with hormone-insensitive tumours, patients on Enhertu lived 6.3 months longer.\n",
            " \n",
            " That the benefit in overall survival was apparent even at the point of interim analysis was surprising, David Fredrickson, executive vice president of AstraZeneca's oncology unit, told Reuters.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"That really puts a lot of confidence that the benefit that we're seeing here is absolutely real.\"\n",
            " \n",
            " A host of targeted therapies has greatly improved the prognosis for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. But more than half of women whose breast cancer has spread to other organs and express little or no HER2 - referred to as HER2-low status - have limited treatment options.\n",
            " \n",
            " Hormone-sensitive patients who received Enhertu also went an average of 10.1 months before their disease began to worsen - a measure known as progression free survival (PFS) - compared with 5.4 months for chemotherapy, which was statistically significant.\n",
            " \n",
            " Enhertu more than doubled the PFS for hormone-insensitive patients at 6.6 months versus 2.9 months for chemotherapy.\n",
            " \n",
            " AstraZeneca is in discussions with regulators globally for approval in the HER2-low population. Jefferies analysts last month forecast $2.5 billion in annual global peak Enhertu sales for these patients, and about $6.6 billion across all indications.\n",
            " \n",
            " The drug, which is administered as an intravenous infusion, is not without safety concerns. It has been linked to a type of lung scarring called interstitial lung disease (ILD). Forty-five Enhertu patients in the trial had varying degrees of ILD versus one in the chemotherapy group.\n",
            " \n",
            " Enhertu belongs to class of therapies called antibody drug conjugates (ADC), which are engineered antibodies that bind to tumour cells and release cell-killing chemicals.\n",
            " \n",
            " Last month, it gained approval as a second-line treatment option after a study showed it reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% compared to Roche's Kadcyla, which has been the standard treatment.\n",
            " \n",
            " Enhertu is being evaluated for use in earlier stages of breast cancer, as well as lung and colorectal cancers, among others. It has secured approval in HER2-driven gastric cancer.\n",
            " \n",
            " \"As far as breast cancer goes, I'd say at least in the next few years, I'm pretty sure in Enhertu is going to kind of finish revolutionising the treatment paradigm,\" Tara Hansen, a consultant at Informa Pharma Custom Intelligence, told Reuters.\n",

data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists three sources familiar with the details told Reuters    AstraZeneca's large latestage US trial has remained on hold since Sept 6 after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis    The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID19 vaccine candidates in development The requested data was expected to arrive this week after which the FDA would need time to analyze it two of the sources said    Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide    The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged 12 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States Other leading companies in the US vaccine race include Pfizer Inc N  Moderna Inc O  and Johnson  Johnson N     Regulators in the UK Brazil India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there    The FDA however wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner researchers at Oxford University the sources said That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines they added    It just shows that the FDA is being thorough said one of the sources    Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the US regulator requires two of the sources said    The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product Oxford did not respond to requests for comment AstraZeneca in a statement said We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial    VIRAL VECTOR    All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses  flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and other diseases  into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection    While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target    Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis prostate cancer and influenza    In one of those trials one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine    The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects the sources said    The US government's effort to speed development of a COVID19 vaccine  and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov 3 presidential election  has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety The FDA has denied this    AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met predetermined safety and efficacy standards    Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID19 up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in midSeptember    The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes or if serious safety problems appear    Safety is likely to have been a major reason for the change said Thomas Lumley chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study    AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol Â Reuters A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this

experimental COVID19 vaccine from AstraZeneca L  and Oxford University in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process    The European Medicines Agency EMA said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted https    The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant    US trials are still under review with regulators widening their probe Reuters reported on Wednesday    This EMA's review does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee the watchdog said    Earlystage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses Data on latestage trials are expected soon    The EMA would make final recommendations once the review is completed to the European Commission which has the ultimate say over approvals The commission typically follows EMA endorsements    The EMA began a similar realtime review of Gilead's O  Veklury as a treatment for COVID19 earlier this year and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July\""

Nov 3 presidential election  has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety The FDA has denied this    AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met predetermined safety and efficacy standards    Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID19 up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in midSeptember    The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes or if serious safety problems appear    Safety is likely to have been a major reason for the change said Thomas Lumley chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study    AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol Â Reuters A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this illustration taken    GILD 111 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    Reuters  The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID19 vaccine from AstraZeneca L  and Oxford University in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process    The European Medicines Agency EMA said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted https    The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant    US trials are still under review with regulators widening their probe Reuters reported on Wednesday    This EMA's review does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee the watchdog said    Earlystage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses Data on latestage trials are expected soon    The EMA would make final recommendations once the review is completed to the European Commission which has the ultimate say over approvals The commission typically follows EMA endorsements    The EMA began a similar realtime review of Gilead's O  Veklury as a treatment for COVID19 earlier this year and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July\""

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.\\n \\n The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.\\n \\n Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.\\n \\n The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.\\n \\n MIXED RESULTS\\n \\n While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs.\\n \\n On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.\\n \\n For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion (5 billion pounds) were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.\\n \\n However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents.\\n \\n Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.\\n \\n The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

Taylor and Dan Levine    WASHINGTON Reuters  The US Food and Drug Administration has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in AstraZeneca Plc's L  COVID19 vaccine study and will look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists three sources familiar with the details told Reuters    AstraZeneca's large latestage US trial has remained on hold since Sept 6 after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis    The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID19 vaccine candidates in development The requested data was expected to arrive this week after which the FDA would need time to analyze it two of the sources said    Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide    The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged 12 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States Other leading companies in the US vaccine race include Pfizer Inc N  Moderna Inc O  and Johnson  Johnson N     Regulators in the UK Brazil India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there    The FDA however wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner researchers at Oxford University the sources said That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines they added    It just shows that the FDA is being thorough said one of the sources    Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the US regulator requires two of the sources said    The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product Oxford did not respond to requests for comment AstraZeneca in a statement said We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial    VIRAL VECTOR    All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses  flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and other diseases  into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection    While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target    Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis prostate cancer and influenza    In one of those trials one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine    The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects the sources said    The US government's effort to speed development of a COVID19 vaccine  and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov 3 presidential election  has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety The FDA has denied this    AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met predetermined safety and efficacy standards    Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID19 up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in midSeptember    The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes or if serious safety problems appear    Safety is likely to have been a major reason for the change said Thomas Lumley chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study    AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol Â Reuters A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this

experimental COVID19 vaccine from AstraZeneca L  and Oxford University in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process    The European Medicines Agency EMA said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted https    The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant    US trials are still under review with regulators widening their probe Reuters reported on Wednesday    This EMA's review does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee the watchdog said    Earlystage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses Data on latestage trials are expected soon    The EMA would make final recommendations once the review is completed to the European Commission which has the ultimate say over approvals The commission typically follows EMA endorsements    The EMA began a similar realtime review of Gilead's O  Veklury as a treatment for COVID19 earlier this year and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July  \n",

toRemove from a Portfolio    By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger    Reuters  A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca's potential COVID19 vaccine leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government    Britain's vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept 30    AstraZeneca L  said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from latestage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelflife of supplies    It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval    We are a little bit late in deliveries which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call    However he added AstraZeneca was fully prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready adding the company's weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans    AstraZeneca and its partner on the project the University of Oxford said data from latestage trials should land this year If successful the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time Soriot said    The British duo are racing with PfizerBioNTech Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID19 vaccine trials A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 12 million deaths roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives    Earlier this year AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval    The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year but only trial data can confirm this    MIXED RESULTS    While working on the vaccine AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline

The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.\\n \\n Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.\\n \\n The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).\\n \\n Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.\\n \\n The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.\\n \\n \"It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,\" said one of the sources.\\n \\n Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.\\n \\n The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: \"We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.\"\\n \\n VIRAL VECTOR\\n \\n All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.\\n \\n While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

Taylor and Dan Levine    WASHINGTON Reuters  The US Food and Drug Administration has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in AstraZeneca Plc's L  COVID19 vaccine study and will look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists three sources familiar with the details told Reuters    AstraZeneca's large latestage US trial has remained on hold since Sept 6 after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis    The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID19 vaccine candidates in development The requested data was expected to arrive this week after which the FDA would need time to analyze it two of the sources said    Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide    The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged 12 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States Other leading companies in the US vaccine race include Pfizer Inc N  Moderna Inc O  and Johnson  Johnson N     Regulators in the UK Brazil India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there    The FDA however wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner researchers at Oxford University the sources said That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines they added    It just shows that the FDA is being thorough said one of the sources    Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the US regulator requires two of the sources said    The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product Oxford did not respond to requests for comment AstraZeneca in a statement said We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial    VIRAL VECTOR    All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses  flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and other diseases  into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection    While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target    Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis prostate cancer and influenza    In one of those trials one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine    The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects the sources said    The US government's effort to speed development of a COVID19 vaccine  and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov 3 presidential election  has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety The FDA has denied this    AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met predetermined safety and efficacy standards    Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID19 up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in midSeptember    The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes or if serious safety problems appear    Safety is likely to have been a major reason for the change said Thomas Lumley chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study    AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol Â Reuters A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this

experimental COVID19 vaccine from AstraZeneca L  and Oxford University in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process    The European Medicines Agency EMA said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted https    The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant    US trials are still under review with regulators widening their probe Reuters reported on Wednesday    This EMA's review does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee the watchdog said    Earlystage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses Data on latestage trials are expected soon    The EMA would make final recommendations once the review is completed to the European Commission which has the ultimate say over approvals The commission typically follows EMA endorsements    The EMA began a similar realtime review of Gilead's O  Veklury as a treatment for COVID19 earlier this year and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July   \n",

J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.\\n \\n Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.\\n \\n Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\n \"As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,\" said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.\\n \\n Infections are rising in 80 countries (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/index.html) as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.\\n \\n J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.\\n \\n J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.\\n \\n J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.\\n \\n So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.\\n \\n AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.\\n \\n AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.\\n \\n Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine is being developed along with researchers at Oxford University.   \n",

They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.\\n \\n Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.\\n \\n In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.\\n \\n The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.\\n \\n The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.\\n \\n AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.\\n \\n Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.\\n \\n The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.\\n \\n \"Safety is likely to have been a major reason\" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.\\n \\n AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol.

AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.\\n \\n The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.\\n \\n Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.\\n \\n Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\\n \\n AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.\\n \\n However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.\\n \\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.\\n \\n In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of \"paramount importance\" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.\\n \\n Sources had told Reuters that the data requested by the FDA for one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development was expected this week.

If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.\\n \\n The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.\\n \\n Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.\\n \\n The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.\\n \\n MIXED RESULTS\\n \\n While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs.\\n \\n On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.\\n \\n For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion (5 billion pounds) were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.\\n \\n However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents.\\n \\n Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.\\n \\n The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.\\n \\n Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.\\n \\n Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.\\n \\n \"As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,\" said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.\\n \\n Infections are rising in 80 countries (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/index.html) as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.\\n \\n J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.\\n \\n J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.\\n \\n J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.\\n \\n So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.\\n \\n AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.\\n \\n AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.\\n \\n Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.\\n \\n

In a recent Twitter... AstraZeneca PLC said Wednesday that Capivasertib plus Faslodex significantly improved progression-free survival when compared with Faslodex combined with a placebo in a Phase 3 trial in advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\\n \\n The Anglo-Swedish pharma giant AZN, +1.77% AZN, +0.56% said the trial met both primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival in the overall patient population and in a prespecified biomarker subgroup of patients whose tumors had qualifying alterations.

Taylor and Dan Levine    WASHINGTON Reuters  The US Food and Drug Administration has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in AstraZeneca Plc's L  COVID19 vaccine study and will look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists three sources familiar with the details told Reuters    AstraZeneca's large latestage US trial has remained on hold since Sept 6 after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis    The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID19 vaccine candidates in development The requested data was expected to arrive this week after which the FDA would need time to analyze it two of the sources said    Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide    The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged 12 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States Other leading companies in the US vaccine race include Pfizer Inc N  Moderna Inc O  and Johnson  Johnson N     Regulators in the UK Brazil India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there    The FDA however wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner researchers at Oxford University the sources said That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines they added    It just shows that the FDA is being thorough said one of the sources    Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the US regulator requires two of the sources said    The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product Oxford did not respond to requests for comment AstraZeneca in a statement said We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial    VIRAL VECTOR    All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses  flu Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and other diseases  into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection    While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target    Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis prostate cancer and influenza    In one of those trials one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine    The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects the sources said    The US government's effort to speed development of a COVID19 vaccine  and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov 3 presidential election  has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety The FDA has denied this    AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met predetermined safety and efficacy standards    Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID19 up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in midSeptember    The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes or if serious safety problems appear    Safety is likely to have been a major reason for the change said Thomas Lumley chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study    AstraZeneca would not say why it had made the change to its protocol Â Reuters A test tube labelled with the Vaccine is seen in front of AstraZeneca logo in this

experimental COVID19 vaccine from AstraZeneca L  and Oxford University in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process    The European Medicines Agency EMA said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted https    The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant    US trials are still under review with regulators widening their probe Reuters reported on Wednesday    This EMA's review does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee the watchdog said    Earlystage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses Data on latestage trials are expected soon    The EMA would make final recommendations once the review is completed to the European Commission which has the ultimate say over approvals The commission typically follows EMA endorsements    The EMA began a similar realtime review of Gilead's O  Veklury as a treatment for COVID19 earlier this year and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July   \n",

toRemove from a Portfolio    By Pushkala Aripaka and Ludwig Burger    Reuters  A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca's potential COVID19 vaccine leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government    Britain's vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept 30    AstraZeneca L  said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from latestage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelflife of supplies    It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers and will only add a final ingredient put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval    We are a little bit late in deliveries which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call    However he added AstraZeneca was fully prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready adding the company's weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans    AstraZeneca and its partner on the project the University of Oxford said data from latestage trials should land this year If successful the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time Soriot said    The British duo are racing with PfizerBioNTech Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID19 vaccine trials A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 12 million deaths roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives    Earlier this year AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval    The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year but only trial data can confirm this    MIXED RESULTS    While working on the vaccine AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline

approval by regulators and Johnson  Johnson N  is preparing to resume its trial on Monday or Tuesday the companies said on Friday    The news signaled progress against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 41 million globally including 8 million Americans and comes 10 days before a US presidential election that may hinge on plans

US trial on Sept 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness believed to be transverse myelitis in a participant in the company's UK trial JJ paused its large latestage trial last week after a study participant became ill    Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators    Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration FDA will be undermined by political pressure and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID19 vaccine    As this trial resumes I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process said Matthew Hepburn head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed a publicprivate partnership to speed inoculation efforts    Infections are rising in 80 countries

Data and Safety Monitoring Board has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill    JJ expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021 JJ's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said    JJ is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States the company said    So far the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness JJ cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules Stoffels said    AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the US Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine    AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the US Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case    Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca US trial was set to resume as early as this week citing four sources familiar with the situation    AstraZeneca's vaccine is
