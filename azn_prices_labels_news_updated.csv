 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has broadened its investigation of a serious illness in AstraZeneca Plc's (L: ) COVID-19 vaccine study and will look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources familiar with the details told Reuters.
 
 AstraZeneca's large, late-stage U.S. trial has remained on hold since Sept. 6, after a study participant in Britain fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
 
 The widened scope of the FDA probe raises the likelihood of additional delays for what has been one of the most advanced COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development. The requested data was expected to arrive this week, after which the FDA would need time to analyze it, two of the sources said.
 
 Effective vaccines are seen as essential to help end a pandemic that has killed more than one million people worldwide.
 
 The administration of President Donald Trump has pledged $1.2 billion to support development of the AstraZeneca vaccine and secure 300 million doses for the United States. Other leading companies in the U.S. vaccine race include Pfizer Inc (N: ), Moderna Inc (O: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ).
 
 Regulators in the UK, Brazil, India and South Africa have allowed AstraZeneca to resume its clinical trials there.
 
 The FDA, however, wants to determine whether similar side effects emerged in trials of other vaccines designed by AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine partner, researchers at Oxford University, the sources said. That does not mean the agency believes there were safety issues associated with any of these vaccines, they added.
 
 ""It just shows that the FDA is being thorough,"" said one of the sources.
 
 Further complicating the situation is that the data requested by FDA is in a different format than what the U.S. regulator requires, two of the sources said.
 
 The FDA declined to comment on discussions involving an experimental product. Oxford did not respond to requests for comment. AstraZeneca, in a statement, said: ""We are continuing to work with the FDA to facilitate review of the information needed to make a decision regarding resumption of the US trial.""
 
 VIRAL VECTOR
 
 All of the vaccines it wants to review use a modified adenovirus as vectors to safely deliver genetic material from the target illnesses - flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and other diseases - into the body to stimulate an immune system response to fight future infection.
 
 While other vaccine developers have used human adenoviruses for such vaccines, the Oxford researchers chose an adenovirus found in chimpanzees. They felt this would reduce the likelihood that an individual's immune system would attack the vector virus due to prior exposure rather than the intended target.
 
 Reuters reviewed six research papers that detailed safety data of vaccines using the engineered chimpanzee adenovirus called ChAdOx1 for diseases including tuberculosis, prostate cancer and influenza.
 
 In one of those trials, one serious adverse event cited by researchers was deemed unrelated to the vaccine.
 
 The type of review being conducted by the FDA is generally intended to scrutinize raw data for other side effects, the sources said.
 
 The U.S. government's effort to speed development of a COVID-19 vaccine - and promises by Trump that one could be available prior to the Nov. 3 presidential election - has led to concerns of political interference in the regulatory process at the expense of safety. The FDA has denied this.
 
 AstraZeneca's vaccine development could also be slowed by a change to its clinical trial protocols to show that it has met pre-determined safety and efficacy standards.
 
 Independent safety monitors will conduct their first review of the vaccine's safety and effectiveness after 75 trial subjects become infected with COVID-19, up from the original initial review plan after about 40 infections, according to a Reuters review of protocol documents issued in July and amended in mid-September.
 
 The safety monitors could decide to stop the trial if the vaccine proves either highly effective, and therefore should be considered for public use before the trial concludes, or if serious safety problems appear.
 
 ""Safety is likely to have been a major reason"" for the change, said Thomas Lumley, chair of biostatistics at the University of Auckland who was not involved with the study.

 (Reuters) - The European health regulator said on Thursday it had started a rolling review of the experimental COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University, in a move aimed at speeding up any future approval process.
 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said its human medicines committee had started evaluating the first batch of data on the vaccine, and will continue till sufficient data is available and a formal application is submitted. (https://
 
 The news raises the chances of the vaccine being the first to be approved in the region, and comes just weeks after several global trials of the vaccine were halted due to an unexplained illness in a study participant.
 
 U.S. trials are still under review, with regulators widening their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
 
 ""This (EMA's review) does not mean that a conclusion can be reached yet on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness, as much of the evidence is still to be submitted to the committee,"" the watchdog said.
 
 Early-stage data in July showed the vaccine elicited immune responses in clinical trials and produced no serious side effects, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses. Data on late-stage trials are expected soon.
 
 The EMA would make final recommendations, once the review is completed, to the European Commission, which has the ultimate say over approvals. The commission typically follows EMA endorsements.
 
 The EMA began a similar real-time review of Gilead's (O: ) Veklury as a treatment for COVID-19 earlier this year, and the antiviral treatment was given conditional approval for use just months later in July.",Â Reuters    UK100 203 Add toRemove from a Portfolio SHEL 077 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio RR 617 Add toRemove from a Portfolio SN 130 Add toRemove

 (Reuters) - Clinical trials of AstraZeneca (L: ) and Oxford University's experimental COVID-19 vaccine have resumed in Japan, almost a month after being put on hold due to an illness of a British volunteer, while discussions with U.S. authorities continue.
 
 The British drugmaker said on Friday the early-to-mid-stage trial for the vaccine against the novel coronavirus resumed in Japan after consultations with the national health regulator, the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency.
 
 Global trials of the vaccine, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, were put on hold on Sept. 6 after a study participant fell ill with what was believed to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
 
 Trials in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and India had already restarted, but U.S. trials remain paused as regulators widened their probe, Reuters reported on Wednesday.
 
 AstraZeneca has called the halt a standard review procedure, and a document posted online by Oxford university last month stated the illness may not have been associated with the vaccine.
 
 However, the incident has drawn focus on the safety of candidates being developed in the race for a successful vaccine against the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has claimed more than a million lives globally.
 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) broadened its investigation of the illness in the volunteer, and would look at data from earlier trials of similar vaccines developed by the same scientists, three sources told Reuters.
 
 In Friday's statement, AstraZeneca stressed that safety of the participants was of ""paramount importance"" and that it was applying the highest standards of conduct in trials.

 (Reuters) - A summer dip in UK coronavirus infections has pushed back test results for AstraZenca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, leading the drugmaker to delay deliveries of shots to the UK government.
 
 Britain's vaccines chief said on Wednesday it would receive just 4 million doses of the potential vaccine this year, against initial estimates for 30 million by Sept. 30.
 
 AstraZeneca (L: ) said on Thursday it was holding back deliveries while it awaits the data from late-stage clinical trials in order to maximise the shelf-life of supplies.
 
 It is keeping the vaccine frozen in large containers, and will only add a final ingredient, put it into vials and keep it at fridge temperature when the vaccine gets closer to approval.
 
 ""We are a little bit late in deliveries, which is why the vaccine has been kept in frozen form,"" CEO Pascal Soriot said on a conference call.
 
 However, he added AstraZeneca was ""fully"" prepared to launch the vaccine when it is ready, adding the company's weekly delivery schedule should roughly match what the UK government has in mind for its vaccination plans.
 
 AstraZeneca and its partner on the project, the University of Oxford, said data from late-stage trials should land this year. If successful, the pair will file for emergency approvals in as many countries as possible at the same time, Soriot said.
 
 The British duo are racing with Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and others to publish the first detailed results from large COVID-19 vaccine trials. A vaccine is seen as the world's best bet for beating a pandemic that has led to more than 1.2 million deaths, roiled economies and disrupted billions of lives.
 
 Earlier this year, AstraZeneca also agreed to start supplying millions of doses by the end of 2020 to the United States, the European Union and poorer nations through epidemic response group CEPI and vaccine alliance GAVI, subject to the results of the trials and regulatory approval.
 
 The company hopes the shot will be effective for at least a year, but only trial data can confirm this.
 
 MIXED RESULTS
 
 While working on the vaccine, AstraZeneca is also making progress on its pipeline of other drugs.
 
 On Thursday, the company said two of its main drugs - cancer treatment Lynparza and diabetes medicine Forxiga - had been approved for wider use in Europe.
 
 For the third quarter, product sales of $6.52 billion (5 billion pounds) were ahead of a company-compiled consensus of $6.50 billion. The number excluded payments from collaborations.
 
 However, core earnings of 94 cents per share for the three months ended Sept. 30 missed analysts' expectations of 98 cents.
 
 Research and development costs jumped 11% to $1.5 billion, as more projects moved into the final stage of testing on humans - typically the most expensive.
 
 The company said it still expected total revenue in 2020 to increase by a high single-digit to a low double-digit percentage and core earnings per share to increase by a mid- to high-teens percentage.",Â Reuters    AVV 016 Add toRemove from a Portfolio TRNT 396 Add toRemove from a Portfolio BIFF 029 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AUTOA 235 Add toRemove from a Portfolio JSAIY 043 Add

 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (N: ) experimental COVID-19 vaccine is more than 90% effective based on initial trial results, the drugmaker said on Monday, a major victory in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world's economy.
 
 Experts welcomed the first successful interim data from a large-scale clinical test as a watershed moment that showed vaccines could help halt the pandemic, although mass roll-outs, which needs regulatory approval, will not happen this year.
 
 Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE (F: ) said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek U.S. authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine, raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December.
 
 If granted, the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
 
 ""Today is a great day for science and humanity,"" said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla.
 
 ""We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records, hospitals nearing over-capacity and economies struggling to reopen,"" he said.
 
 Experts said they still wanted to see the full trial data, which have yet to be peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal, but the preliminary results looked encouraging.
 
 ""This news made me smile from ear to ear. It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID-19 vaccines in general,"" said Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford.
 
 There are still many questions, such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age, and how long it will provide immunity, with the ""new normal"" of social distancing and face covering set to remain for the foreseeable future.
 
 Pfizer expects to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85. To do so, it will need two months of safety data from about half the study's 44,000 participants, which is expected in the third week of November.
 
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for U.S. regulators to receive and process data on the vaccine before the government could potentially approve it.
 
 MARKETS SURGE
 
 The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the S&P 500 and hitting record highs as shares of banks, oil companies and travel companies soared. Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns, such as conferencing platform Zoom Video (O: ) and online retailers, tumbled.
 
 Pfizer shares jumped more than 11% to their highest since July last year, while BioNTech's stock hit a record high.
 
 Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson & Johnson (N: ) up 4% and Moderna Inc (O: ), whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot, up 8%. Britain's AstraZeneca (L: ), however, fell 2%. Moderna is expected to report results from its large-scale trial later this month.
 
 ""The efficacy data are really impressive. This is better than most of us anticipated,"" said William Schaffner, infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee. ""The study isn't completed yet, but nonetheless the data look very solid.""
 
 U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the test results, and the market boost: ""STOCK MARKET UP BIG, VACCINE COMING SOON. REPORT 90% EFFECTIVE. SUCH GREAT NEWS!"" he tweeted.
 
 President-elect Joe Biden said the news was excellent but did not change the fact that face masks, social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year.
 
 The World Health Organization said the results were very positive, but warned there was a funding gap of $4.5 billion that could slow access to tests, medicines and vaccines in low- and middle-income countries.
 
 'NEAR ECSTATIC'
 
 ""I'm near ecstatic,"" Bill Gruber, one of Pfizer's top vaccine scientists, said in an interview. ""This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we're now in.""
 
 Between 55% and 65% of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID-19, said Germany's health minister Jens Spahn, adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021.
 
 The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
 
 The companies have a $1.95 billion contract with the U.S. government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year. They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program.
 
 The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
 
 Pfizer said the interim analysis, conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID-19, examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo.
 
 Pfizer did not break down how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine. Still, over 90% effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had been given the vaccine, which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart.
 
 The efficacy rate, which could drop once full results are available, is well above the 50% effectiveness required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine.
 
 Shortly after Pfizer's announcement, Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90% effective, based on data collated from inoculations of the public. Its preliminary Phase III trial data is due to be published this month.
 
 MORE DATA NEEDED
 
 To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases among volunteers. Bourla told CNBC on Monday that based on rising infection rates, the trial could be completed before the end of November.
 
 Pfizer said its data would be peer reviewed once it has results from the entire trial.
 
 ""These are interesting first signals, but again they are only communicated in press releases,"" said Marylyn Addo, head of tropical medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany.
 
 Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China.
 
 The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks, and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines. The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.

 SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors expecting an imminent COVID-19 vaccine are beginning to buy bank stocks and industrials in anticipation of a roaring return in consumer confidence, though many remain wary of risks in sectors ravaged by the pandemic.
 
 The development of some kind of preventative medicine is seen as the best chance of halting the coronavirus, which has killed 1.2 million people and is the top issue for money managers eyeing the next major shift in financial markets.
 
 As the market hype around the U.S. election ebbs, investors are now preparing for good vaccine news, which they believe is a matter of when, not if.
 
 ""It's going to be absolutely massive,"" said Stuart Oakley, head of cash currency trading at Nomura in London. ""If we get a vaccine, we're going to see all that pent up demand coming out.""
 
 Of the roughly 45 vaccines undergoing human trials, those from Pfizer (N: ) and Moderna (O: ) are seen as possibly winning regulatory approval this year, with AstraZeneca (L: ) not far behind.
 
 Investors are looking beyond an expected ""excitement rally"" and at longer-term beneficiaries and short-selling opportunities.
 
 ""What we've done is given ourselves some optionality for a recovery trade, or a vaccine trade, by having some exposure to financials,"" said Binay Chandgothia, a Hong Kong-based portfolio manager at Principal Global Investors.
 
 Banks benefit from increased economic activity and would be helped if bond yields rose, he said, adding he had increased exposure to growth-sensitive small companies and would buy stocks in Singapore and Hong Kong if trade and travel pick up.
 
 Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist at Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) Asset Management in Wisconsin, said industrials offered broad exposure to a rebound in confidence in areas from building products to aviation.
 
 Deutsche Bank (DE: ) manages a ""vaccine basket"" of Singapore dollars and Thai baht, seen benefitting from increased trade and tourism, against the Philippine peso, which is weighed by rising imports.
 
 Financials <.dMIWO0FN00PUS> and industrials ( ) have gained with the broader market this month, but badly lag a roughly 5% gain in world stocks ( ) this year. The baht has also surged recently against the peso ( ).
 
 THREAD THE NEEDLE
 
 Investors are also setting up short positions.
 
 Shinji Naito at Japan's SPARX Asset Management, which has $12 billion under management, hopes a vaccine could trigger a payoff from shorts in stocks pumped up by the pandemic, such as some technology firms, while helping long investments such as realtor Tokyo Tatemono (T: ).
 
 Dave Wang, a portfolio manager at Nuvest Capital in Singapore, said long-short pairs could wring gains from what is likely to be an uneven recovery.
 
 For example, airports, which charge per aircraft regardless of their loads, could perform better than airlines hit by low patronage and rising fuel costs.
 
 Of course, not everyone is scrambling for a piece of the action amid questions about the timing, efficacy and distribution of any vaccine still remaining.
 
 ""You're better off being a bit too late than too early,"" said Hugh Dive, chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management in Sydney, noting delays would leave under-pressure companies needing to raise more money quickly.
 
 Others, however, feel it is now safe to bet on a global rebound, which a vaccine would boost.
 
 ""I think there's two different trades,"" said Sean Taylor, chief investment officer in Asia for German fund manager DWS. ""A vaccine trade and a cyclical trade. I'm more positioning in cyclicals,"" he said. ""If we got much more credible data for vaccines, then I'd add services.""",22 Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A sign is pictured outside Pfizer Headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York City 22    DJI

on Monday a major victory in the war against a virus that has killed over a million people and battered the world's economy    Experts welcomed the first successful interim data from a largescale clinical test as a watershed moment that showed vaccines could help halt the pandemic although mass rollouts which needs regulatory approval will not happen this year    Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE F  said they had found no serious safety concerns yet and expected to seek US authorization this month for emergency use of the vaccine raising the chance of a regulatory decision as soon as December    If granted the companies estimate they can roll out up to 50 million doses this year enough to protect 25 million people and then produce up to 13 billion doses in 2021    Today is a great day for science and humanity said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla    We are reaching this critical milestone in our vaccine development program at a time when the world needs it most with infection rates setting new records hospitals nearing overcapacity and economies struggling to reopen he said    Experts said they still wanted to see the full trial data which have yet to be peerreviewed or published in a medical journal but the preliminary results looked encouraging    This news made me smile from ear to ear It is a relief to see such positive results on this vaccine and bodes well for COVID19 vaccines in general said Peter Horby professor of emerging infectious diseases at the University of Oxford    There are still many questions such as how effective the vaccine is by ethnicity or age and how long it will provide immunity with the new normal of social distancing and face covering set to remain for the foreseeable future    Pfizer expects to seek US emergency use authorization for people aged 16 to 85 To do so it will need two months of safety data from about half the study's 44000 participants which is expected in the third week of November    US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said it would take several weeks for US regulators to receive and process data on the vaccine before the government could potentially approve it    MARKETS SURGE    The prospect of a vaccine electrified world markets with the SP 500 and hitting record highs as shares of banks oil companies and travel companies soared Shares in companies that have thrived during lockdowns such as conferencing platform Zoom Video O  and online retailers tumbled    Pfizer shares jumped more than 11 to their highest since July last year while BioNTech's stock hit a record high    Shares of other vaccine developers in the final stage of testing also rose with Johnson  Johnson N  up 4 and Moderna Inc O  whose vaccine uses a similar technology as the Pfizer shot up 8 Britain's AstraZeneca L  however fell 2 Moderna is expected to report results from its largescale trial later this month    The efficacy data are really impressive This is better than most of us anticipated said William Schaffner infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville Tennessee The study isn't completed yet but nonetheless the data look very solid    US President Donald Trump welcomed the test results and the market boost STOCK MARKET UP BIG VACCINE COMING SOON REPORT 90 EFFECTIVE SUCH GREAT NEWS he tweeted    Presidentelect Joe Biden said the news was excellent but did not change the fact that face masks social distancing and other health measures would be needed well into next year    The World Health Organization said the results were very positive but warned there was a funding gap of 45 billion that could slow access to tests medicines and vaccines in low and middleincome countries    'NEAR ECSTATIC'    I'm near ecstatic Bill Gruber one of Pfizer's top vaccine scientists said in an interview This is a great day for public health and for the potential to get us all out of the circumstances we're now in    Between 55 and 65 of the population will need to be vaccinated to break the dynamic of the spread of COVID19 said Germany's health minister Jens Spahn adding that he did not expect a shot to be available before the first quarter of 2021    The European Union said on Monday it would soon sign a contract for up to 300 million doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID19 vaccine    The companies have a 195 billion contract with the US government to deliver 100 million vaccine doses beginning this year They did not receive research funding from the Trump administration's Operation Warp Speed vaccine program    The drugmakers have also reached supply agreements with the United Kingdom Canada and Japan    Pfizer said the interim analysis conducted after 94 participants in the trial developed COVID19 examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo    Pfizer did not break down how many of those who fell ill received the vaccine Still over 90 effectiveness implies that no more than 8 of the 94 had been given the vaccine which was administered in two shots about three weeks apart    The efficacy rate which could drop once full results are available is well above the 50 effectiveness required by the US Food and Drug Administration for a coronavirus vaccine    Shortly after Pfizer's announcement Russia said its Sputnik V vaccine was also more than 90 effective based on data collated from inoculations of the public Its preliminary Phase III trial data is due to be published this month    MORE DATA NEEDED    To confirm the efficacy rate Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID19 cases among volunteers Bourla told CNBC on Monday that based on rising infection rates the trial could be completed before the end of November    Pfizer said its data would be peer reviewed once it has results from the entire trial    These are interesting first signals but again they are only communicated in press releases said Marylyn Addo head of tropical medicine at the University Medical Center HamburgEppendorf in Germany    Dozens of drugmakers and research groups around the globe have been racing to develop vaccines against COVID19 which on Sunday exceeded 50 million cases since the new coronavirus first emerged late last year in China    The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA mRNA technology which relies on synthetic genes that can be generated and manufactured in weeks and produced at scale more rapidly than conventional vaccines The technology is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens such as actual virus particles    The Trump administration has said it will have enough vaccine doses for all of the 330 million US residents who want it by the middle of 2021 Â Reuters A woman holds a small bottle

 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (L: ) is still waiting for the U.S. drug regulator to approve the restart of the clinical trial of its potential COVID-19 vaccine in the United States almost three weeks after it was paused due to safety concerns.
 
 The U.S. trial of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine candidate, initially developed by the University of Oxford, remains on hold while regulators investigate an illness in one of the participants, even after a British study and other programmes outside of the United States have resumed.
 
 ""We are the sponsor of the U.S. study. We then provided all this information to the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and we are waiting to hear their decision,"" Soriot told a virtual World Economic Forum discussion.
 
 U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on Wednesday the continued suspension showed the FDA was taking vaccine safety seriously.
 
 A document posted online by Oxford university last week stated the illness in a British participant that triggered the pause on Sept. 6 may not have been associated with the vaccine.
 
 Asked why the company had not disclosed details about the nature of the illness, Soriot said clinical trial regulators and independent supervisors were guarding participants' privacy.
 
 Still, the company would look into increasing transparency without compromising individual rights and while also preventing the public and volunteers from drawing wrong conclusions, which could endanger trial enrollment.
 
 ""We are discussing with other companies as an industry what information we can offer without compromising patient privacy but also without compromising the trial itself,"" said the CEO.
 
 Soriot also said that tests of the vaccine prototype on children had not started yet.

 (Reuters) - London's FTSE 100 traded flat on Friday as a surge in COVID-19 cases offset support from a tech-driven rally on Wall Street, but the blue-chip index was set to record its second straight weekly drop on fading hopes of an economic recovery.
 
 The FTSE 100 index ( ) was down 0.07%. For the week so far, it has shed 2.9%, with stocks of auto makers ( ), travel ( ) and insurers ( ) being the biggest laggards on surging infections and new movement curbs.
 
 The mid-cap index ( ) was up 0.3% on Friday.
 
 The general retailers index ( ) was the only sector posting a weekly gain as retail sales picked up and the consumer confidence index in September rose to its highest level since March, a survey showed.
 
 ""The possibility of more severe measures to be adopted in the UK if cases spiral out is keeping sentiment towards UK equities largely risk averse,"" said Keith Temperton, a sales trader at Forte Securities.
 
 Gains on the blue-chip recorded in the previous month have begun to peter out as rising infections and an economic uncertainty overshadowed support from past stimulus measures.
 
 British car production fell nearly by a half in August as the sector continued to suffer due to the COVID-19 pandemic-led impact on demand, an industry body said.

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments will pay claims above an agreed limit against AstraZeneca over side-effects from its potential COVID-19 vaccine, under different terms to a deal struck with Sanofi, an EU official told Reuters.
 
 The deals reflect different strategies by two of the world's top drugmakers for protecting themselves as a debate rages about liabilities for vaccines aimed at ending the pandemic.
 
 AstraZeneca (L: ) has secured the European Union's backing in a confidential agreement which reflects the lower price sought by the British drugmaker, the official said.
 
 ""If a company asks for a higher price we don't give the same conditions,"" said the official, who was involved in the talks but declined to be identified as the contracts are confidential.
 
 Unexpected side-effects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare, but the speed at which a COVID-19 vaccine is being pursued increases the risks of unforeseen conditions.
 
 The deal with AstraZeneca, which shifts some of the risks involved in the roll-out of a vaccine to taxpayers, was struck in August and its liability clauses have not previously been reported.
 
 Under the deal, AstraZeneca would only pay legal costs up to a certain threshold, the official said, declining to elaborate on how the costs would be shared with individual European governments or the cap.
 
 The financial shield would cover both legal costs and potential compensation, which is rarer but potentially a much bigger outlay in the event of something going wrong.
 
 In return for the higher price paid for its vaccine, French drugmaker Sanofi (PA: ), which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner, did not get any liability waiver.
 
 Spokespeople for AstraZeneca, Sanofi and the European Commission declined to comment on the specifics of the deals.
 
 When asked about AstraZeneca's relatively low price, a spokesman reiterated the company's pledge to share the vaccine widely and not to turn a profit from it during the pandemic.
 
 Under the AstraZeneca deal, EU countries have agreed to pay 2.5 euros ($2.92) per dose, while Sanofi has negotiated a price at around 10 euros, the official said.
 
 SIDE-EFFECTS
 
 As part of the supply deals, the only two sealed so far by Brussels, the EU has also made a non-refundable downpayment of 336 million euros to AstraZeneca to secure 400 million doses, proportionately lower than the 324 million euros it paid to Sanofi to secure 300 million doses.
 
 The EU official told Reuters that the contract with AstraZeneca included a narrow definition of side-effects that could limit the possibility of claiming compensation although the company remains liable for its vaccine.
 
 The deal with AstraZeneca was negotiated before it paused late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate this month after a British volunteer developed neurological symptoms. Trials have resumed in Britain but not in the United States.
 
 EU governments would share compensation costs only if unexpected side-effects emerged after the AstraZeneca vaccine was approved.
 
 Liability has been a key stumbling block in talks with other COVID-19 vaccine makers, EU officials have said, as companies fear they risk larger legal costs than they usually face when vaccines are developed in much longer trials.
 
 A European Commission spokesman said advance purchase deals ""provide for member states to indemnify the manufacturer for certain liabilities incurred under specific and strict conditions"", but ""liability still remains with the companies"".
 
 This means it would be the firm's responsibility to defend its shot in the courts.
 
 Drugmakers have called on EU regulators to set up a Europe-wide compensation scheme, while patients' organisations are calling for an EU-wide fund financed by pharmaceutical firms that would compensate for unexpected side-effects.
 
 The EU legal regime is among the least favourable to drugmakers on compensation claims, although plaintiffs have rarely managed to win as the law requires them to prove the link between an illness and a vaccine that may have caused it.
 
 The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID-19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval.
 
 Meanwhile, Russia has said it would shoulder some of the legal liability should anything go wrong with the vaccine developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute. Â© Reuters.

governments will pay claims above an agreed limit against AstraZeneca over sideeffects from its potential COVID19 vaccine under different terms to a deal struck with Sanofi an EU official told Reuters    The deals reflect different strategies by two of the world's top drugmakers for protecting themselves as a debate rages about liabilities for vaccines aimed at ending the pandemic    AstraZeneca L  has secured the European Union's backing in a confidential agreement which reflects the lower price sought by the British drugmaker the official said    If a company asks for a higher price we don't give the same conditions said the official who was involved in the talks but declined to be identified as the contracts are confidential    Unexpected sideeffects after a drug has regulatory approval are rare but the speed at which a COVID19 vaccine is being pursued increases the risks of unforeseen conditions    The deal with AstraZeneca which shifts some of the risks involved in the rollout of a vaccine to taxpayers was struck in August and its liability clauses have not previously been reported    Under the deal AstraZeneca would only pay legal costs up to a certain threshold the official said declining to elaborate on how the costs would be shared with individual European governments or the cap    The financial shield would cover both legal costs and potential compensation which is rarer but potentially a much bigger outlay in the event of something going wrong    In return for the higher price paid for its vaccine French drugmaker Sanofi PA  which is working with GlaxoSmithKline as a partner did not get any liability waiver    Spokespeople for AstraZeneca Sanofi and the European Commission declined to comment on the specifics of the deals    When asked about AstraZeneca's relatively low price a spokesman reiterated the company's pledge to share the vaccine widely and not to turn a profit from it during the pandemic    Under the AstraZeneca deal EU countries have agreed to pay 25 euros 292 per dose while Sanofi has negotiated a price at around 10 euros the official said    SIDEEFFECTS    As part of the supply deals the only two sealed so far by Brussels the EU has also made a nonrefundable downpayment of 336 million euros to AstraZeneca to secure 400 million doses proportionately lower than the 324 million euros it paid to Sanofi to secure 300 million doses    The EU official told Reuters that the contract with AstraZeneca included a narrow definition of sideeffects that could limit the possibility of claiming compensation although the

 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - World Bank President David Malpass said on Tuesday he is seeking board approval for a $12 billion coronavirus vaccine financing plan to help poor and developing countries secure a sufficient share of vaccine doses when they become available in the coming months.
 
 Malpass told Reuters in an exclusive interview that the initiative, part of $160 billion in coronavirus aid financing pledged by the multilateral lender, is aimed at helping countries procure and distribute vaccines early to health care and other essential workers and expand global production. He said the board was expected to consider the plan in early October.
 
 Global competition for early coronairus vaccine doses is already fierce, months ahead of any approvals, as wealthy countries move to secure supplies.
 
 The U.S. government has pledged over $3 billion to secure hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines under development by Britain's AstraZeneca (L: ) and by U.S. drug giant Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Germany's BioNTech SE (F: ).
 
 Malpass said the World Bank plan aimed to put poor and middle-income countries, where the virus is spreading most rapidly, on the same footing as richer countries by ensuring have financing to secure supplies and a system for distribution, which will encourage drug makers to meet their demand.
 
 Without early doses that can bring outbreaks under control, many of these countries risk economic collapse that will push hundreds of millions of people back into poverty.
 
 ""Our goal is to alter the course of the pandemic for the low and middle income developing countries,"" Malpass said. ""This is a market signal to the manufacturers that there will be financing available for the developing countries and there will be demand. We will begin asking the manufacturers to begin creating allocations for these countries.""Malpass said the World Bank also was asking wealthy countries that have ""over-reserved"" more doses than they will ultimately need, to release those doses to poorer countries.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/exclusive-world-bank-seeks-board-approval-for-12-billion-coronavirus-vaccine-financing-plan-2222821,0.057,0.833,0.109,0.9545,"2/2 Â© Reuters.

 PARIS/PRAGUE (Reuters) - France imposed curfews while other European nations are closing schools, cancelling surgeries and enlisting student medics as overwhelmed authorities face the nightmare scenario of a COVID-19 resurgence at the onset of winter.
 
 With new cases hitting about 100,000 daily, Europe has by a wide margin overtaken the United States, where more than 51,000 COVID-19 infections are reported on average every day.
 
 As cases in France climbed rapidly, President Emmanuel Macron announced night curfews for four weeks from Saturday in Paris and other major cities, affecting almost one-third of the country's 67 million people.
 
 Macron said in an interview on national television that the curfews were to halt temporarily ""the parties, the moments of conviviality where there are 50 or 60 people, festive evenings because, unfortunately, these are vectors for the acceleration of the disease.""
 
 ""We'll get through this if we stick together,"" he said.
 
 Most European governments eased lockdowns over the summer to start reviving economies already battered by the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic.
 
 But the return of normal activity - from packed restaurants to new university terms - fuelled a sharp spike in cases all over the continent.
 
 German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that she and leaders of Germany's 16 states agreed on Wednesday on tougher measures without detailing them. ""We are already in a phase of exponential growth, the daily numbers show that,"" she said.
 
 Bars and pubs were among the first to shut or face earlier closing in the new lockdowns, but now the surging infection rates are also testing governments' resolve to keep schools and non-COVID medical care going.
 
 Even Pope Francis was subject to new coronavirus rules, staying put at a safe distance from well-wishers at his weekly audience on Wednesday.
 
 In Lisbon, football fans were unsurprised after Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo tested positive for the virus, saying it simply showed everyone was at risk of getting infected.
 
 The Czech Republic, with Europe's worst rate per capita, has shifted schools to distance learning and plans to call up thousands of medical students. Hospitals are cutting non-urgent medical procedures to free up beds.
 
 ""Sometimes we are at the edge of crying,"" said Lenka Krejcova, a head nurse at Slany hospital near Prague, as builders hurried to turn a general ward into a COVID-19 department.
 
 Poland is ramping up training for nurses and considering creating military field hospitals, Moscow is to move many students to online learning and Northern Ireland is closing schools for two weeks and restaurants for four.
 
 Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin described Northern Ireland's rise in cases as ""hugely worrying,"" and the government increased restrictions in three counties on the border as well as almost all visits to homes across the country.
 
 ""We are on the brink of disaster,"" immunologist Pawel Grzesiowski said in Poland, which reported a record 6,526 infections and 116 deaths on Wednesday.
 
 Efforts to develop a vaccine hit snags in some areas, with Johnson & Johnson (N: ) pausing its trial after an unexplained illness in a study participant. AstraZeneca's (L: ) U.S. trial has remained on hold for more than a month.
 
 Russia, which recorded a record daily increase in cases, has meanwhile granted regulatory approval to a second vaccine.
 
 IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES
 
 Germany, England and France have so far resisted pressure to close schools, but in Germany, politicians are debating whether to extend the Christmas-New Year school break to curb contagion.
 
 The Netherlands returned to partial lockdown, closing bars and restaurants, but kept schools open.
 
 European infections have been running at an average of almost 100,000 a day - about a third of the global total - forcing governments to tighten restrictions while attempting to avoid destroying livelihoods.
 
 The United Kingdom, France, Russia and Spain accounted for more than half of Europe's new cases in the week to Oct. 11, according to the World Health Organization.
 
 In the United States, with the world's highest number of confirmed infections, 22 states have so far in October set records for increases in new cases. But deaths are trending downward and have averaged 700 a day over the last week.
 
 FIELD HOSPITALS
 
 British Prime Minister Boris Johnson faces opposition calls for another national lockdown in England, but has so far resisted. Hospital admissions, however, are climbing and field hospitals constructed in the spring are once more being readied.
 
 London faces tighter restrictions within days, the Financial Times reported.
 
 In Spain, authorities in Catalonia ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days and limited the numbers of people allowed in shops.
 
 In Belgium, with Europe's second worst infection rate per capita, hospitals must now reserve a quarter of their beds for COVID-19 patients.
 
 ""We can't see the end of the tunnel today,"" Renaud Mazy, managing director of the University Clinics of Saint-Luc in Brussels, told La Premiere radio.
 
 In Australia, one of the most successful countries in fighting the virus, clusters have emerged in the two most populous states, prompting New South Wales to delay relaxing some restrictions.

 LONDON (Reuters) - ""Human challenge"" trials of potential COVID-19 vaccines, where volunteers are deliberately infected with the disease, could become a reality after a British biotech firm said it was in advanced talks with the government to create and provide strains of the virus.
 
 Preliminary work for the trials, which aim to speed up the process of determining the efficacy of a vaccine candidate, is being carried out by hVIVO, a unit of pharmaceutical services group Open Orphan (L: ), the company said.
 
 ""We are in discussions with numerous parties including the UK government around a COVID-19 challenge study, and once any of those contracts are signed we will make an announcement,"" said Open Orphan's executive chairman, Cathal Friel.
 
 If agreed, this would involve creating a human challenge study model that could be used should such trials gain ethical and safety approval from regulators.
 
 A government spokesman said the UK was ""working with partners to understand how we might collaborate on the potential development of a COVID-19 vaccine through human challenge studies"".
 
 ""Any potential study must meet the UKâ€™s robust regulatory and ethical frameworks,"" the spokesman added.
 
 Supporters of human challenge trials say they are a good way to cut short the often lengthy process of testing potential vaccines on tens of thousands of volunteers in the real world who go about normal life and are monitored to see if they contract the disease or are protected from it.
 
 In these tightly-controlled trials, volunteers are given a vaccine and then about a month later are deliberately infected with the disease under controlled conditions. They are then isolated in a quarantine facility and monitored to see if they become sick or if the vaccine protects them.
 
 Critics say deliberately infecting someone with a potentially deadly disease for which there is currently no effective treatment is unethical.
 
 Leading vaccine developers AstraZeneca (L: ), Sanofi (PA: ), BioNTech (O: ), Moderna (O: ) and Inovio (O: ) said last month that their respective vaccine candidates were not involved in the programme.
 
 Germany's CureVac (DE: ) on Friday said participation in a human challenge trial had not been decided yet because the circumstances would have to be clearer.
 
 Johnson & Johnson (N: ) has previously said it was evaluating the potential benefit of such trials.
 
 Any human challenge trials conducted in Britain would have to be approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the healthcare regulator that looks into safety, ethics and protocol.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/britain-moves-closer-to-covid19-vaccine-trials-that-infect-volunteers-2234032,0.046,0.811,0.143,0.9912,"Â© Reuters.

 CHICAGO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc's (L: ) COVID-19 vaccine trial in the United States is expected to resume as early as this week after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration completed its review of a serious illness in a study participant, four sources told Reuters.
 
 AstraZeneca's large, late-stage U.S. trial has been on hold since Sept. 6, after a participant in the company's UK trial fell ill with what was suspected to be a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.
 
 The sources, who were briefed on the matter but asked to remain anonymous, said they have been told the trial could resume later this week. It was unclear how the FDA would characterize the illness, they said.
 
 An FDA spokeswoman declined to comment.
 
 The agency is requiring researchers conducting the trial to add information about the incident to consent forms signed by study participants, according to one of the sources.
 
 UK regulatory officials previously reviewed the illness and determined there was â€œinsufficient evidence to say for certainâ€ that it was or was not related to the vaccine. It permitted the trial to resume in the UK, according to a draft of the updated consent form shared with Reuters.
 
 â€œIn this case, after considering the information, the independent reviewers and MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) recommended that vaccinations should continue,â€ the draft consent form stated. â€œClose monitoring of the affected individual and other participants will be continued.â€
 
 Regulators in Brazil, India and South Africa also previously allowed AstraZeneca to resume its vaccine trials there.
 
 AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University researchers, had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to produce a vaccine for COVID-19 until its trials were put on hold to investigate the illness. Early data from large-scale trials in the United States of vaccines from Pfizer Inc (N: ) and Moderna Inc (O: ) are expected some time next month.
 
 Johnson & Johnson (N: ) last week paused its Phase III COVID-19 vaccine trial to investigate an unexplained illness in a study participant. At the time of the announcement, the company did not know whether the volunteer had been given its vaccine or a placebo.
 
 A J&J spokesman on Tuesday said the study remains on pause as the company continues its review of medical information before deciding to restart the trial. J&J noted last week that its ""study pause"" was voluntary. By contrast, AstraZeneca's trial is on ""regulatory hold,"" which is imposed by health authorities.
 
 Vaccines are seen as essential to helping end the pandemic that has battered economies around the world and claimed more than 1 million lives - over 220,000 of them in the United States.
 
 Responding to a request about the AstraZeneca trial, British regulators shared with Reuters a draft of a form letter to UK vaccine trial participants, dated Oct. 14 and signed by the Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Team. It says the U.S. FDA had â€œcompleted their analysisâ€ and said vaccination under the study in the United States would resume shortly.
 
 FDA ""has come to the same conclusion as the other drug regulators including the MHRA,"" the letter states.
 
 The Health Research Authority, which helps oversee UK medical research, said in an email to Reuters that it vetted the communication to make sure it was suitable to ensure informed consent among study volunteers. It could not confirm that the letter had been issued.
 
 An AstraZeneca spokeswoman said the communication is not from the company and it ""cannot verify the content,"" referring to the draft letter to study participants.
 
 ""We also cannot comment on a pending FDA decision,"" she said. The Oxford study team did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE
 
 In another of the documents directed at trial participants, the Oxford vaccine study team noted that there was not enough evidence to link the neurological problem seen in the UK trial to the vaccine.
 
 Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia, who reviewed the document, said it can be difficult to link a rare side effect specifically to a vaccine to the exclusion of other potential causes.
 
 Transverse myelitis, which the study volunteer is believed to have developed, typically occurs at a rate of 1-in-200,000 people, Offit said, so it would be unusual to see it in a trial of 9,000 individuals.
 
 Other viruses including those that cause West Nile and polio can trigger the condition, as can physical trauma.
 
 The regulators have to weigh whether a rare side effect is vaccine-related and could occur again against the sickness and deaths linked with COVID-19, Offit said. ""That's always the line that you walk.""",Â Reuters    UK100 203 Add toRemove from a Portfolio XAUUSD 317 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio GSK 017 Add toRemove from

 (Reuters) - British mid-caps jumped on Thursday, erasing earlier losses after a positive update on AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine candidate and as finance minister Rishi Sunak unveiled more support for businesses hit by the pandemic.
 
 The domestically-focussed mid-cap FTSE 250 ( ) rose 0.9% to recoup declines from earlier in the week, with pubs and restaurant operators Marston's Plc (L: ), J D Wetherspoon Plc (L: ) and Mitchells & Butlers Plc (L: ) jumping between 1.3% and 7%.
 
 The blue-chip FTSE 100 index ( ) also added 0.1% after a study found AstraZeneca Plc's (L: ) Oxford COVID-19 vaccine accurately followed the genetic instructions programmed into it to successfully provoke a strong immune response.
 
 ""Vaccine news tends to be one of the big market movers so it looks like that, probably combined with Sunak's announcement, (is why) we have seen the market shift into the green,"" said Connor Campbell, market analyst at Spreadex.
 
 Fears about new coronavirus-led restrictions as well as Brexit-related uncertainty have weighed on UK stock markets recently, with the FTSE 100 still on course for its second straight week of declines.
 
 The new measures announced by Sunak included easing the eligibility for his jobs support scheme and new cash grants for affected businesses.
 
 In company news, Unilever Plc (L: ) rose 0.6% after it reported a stronger-than-expected return to sales growth in the third quarter, led by emerging markets where it generates the bulk of its revenue.
 
 Rentokil Initial Plc (L: ) gained 4.8% as the pest control firm posted a 9.8% rise in third-quarter revenue due to higher demand for its disinfection services.
 
 Britain is set to resume talks on a post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union on Thursday, marking a new push by the two sides to protect billions of dollars worth of trade from the beginning of next year.

 LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Thursday said it would partner with an Oxford-based firm to provide testing for the T cell response of coronavirus vaccine candidates to try to assess their immune responses.
 
 T cell immunity is thought to be essential to protection against infection from the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus, and could provide longer term immunity than antibodies.
 
 The UK Vaccine Taskforce has chosen Oxford Immunotec to supply T cell testing for its assessment of different vaccine candidates.
 
 ""It is important to be able to assess the different vaccines head-to-head and the T cell response is part of our portfolio of accredited assays that we are employing for cross comparisons,"" Kate Bingham, chair of the UK Vaccines Taskforce, said in a statement.
 
 Britain has signed supply deals for six different coronavirus vaccine candidates, including those being made by AstraZeneca (L: ) and Pfizer (N: ) and BioNTech (F: ), seen as among the frontrunners in the race for a vaccine.
 
 Oxford Immunotec said its techonology platform enabled the centralisation of fresh blood samples from different locations to measure the T cell response in a standardised way.
 
 It said the platform, known as T-SPOT, was being used to identify the T cells made in response to the pathogen that causes tuberculosis.",Â Reuters    GBPUSD 190 Add toRemove from a Portfolio UK100

 (Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden faced off for the last time before the Nov. 3 election. Bloomberg News is checking the facts behind their claims in Thursdayâ€™s debate:
 
 Trump claims Biden got money from China and Ukraine through his son Hunter:
 
 CLAIM: A man named Tony Bobulinski told reporters in Nashville before the debate that Hunter Biden, the former vice presidentâ€™s son, recruited him to be the chief executive officer of a proposed partnership between a Chinese company and the Biden family.
 
 At an event called by the Trump campaign, Bobulinski said that a May 13, 2017 email from Hunter Biden called for providing a stake in the company for â€œthe big guy,â€ which he said was a nickname Hunter often used for his father. But Bobulinski, who was invited by Trump to be his guest at the debate, offered no evidence and took no questions. Bloomberg News canâ€™t verify that Bobulinski has any connection to Hunter Biden or his father.
 
 Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement that â€œJoe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever. He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him.â€
 
 On Ukraine, Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, an energy company there. The New York Post says a laptop allegedly abandoned by Hunter Biden included emails suggesting the former vice president met with a senior official from the company. If true, it contradicts Joe Bidenâ€™s insistence that he had no involvement in his sonâ€™s business dealings and never discussed them with him. Bloomberg News hasnâ€™t verified the authenticity of the emails, and the Biden campaign has denied such a meeting ever took place.
 
 Biden has released his tax returns from 1998 through last year. Thereâ€™s Jill reported taxable income of $944,737 in 2019, paying 31.7% of it in taxes. The Bidens earn money in a variety of ways, including fees for speeches, royalties from books and salaries from teaching roles.
 
 Biden claims Trump was hiding a Chinese bank account
 
 A report in the New York Times revealed a Chinese bank account controlled by a Trump entity called Trump International Hotels Management LLC. The paper said tax records show it paid $188,561 in taxes in China while pursuing licensing deals there from 2013 to 2015. Trump said in the debate that it was a business account when he was considering doing business in China and that he believes the account was closed in 2015.
 
 Trump claims U.S. response to the virus was effective
 
 By most measures, the U.S. pandemic response has been chaotic and the results catastrophic. The U.S. has had more than 222,000 deaths attributed to Covid-19, and more than 8.3 million cases. Thatâ€™s more cases than any other nation, including India, which has a population four times that of the U.S. It is true that the U.S. hasnâ€™t had the most deaths per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University. Its death rate is behind Peru, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Spain, Chile, Ecuador and Mexico.
 
 Still, more than perhaps any other developed nation, the U.S. coronavirus response has been marked by confusion that has kept the countryâ€™s numbers surging while many other nations hit by the virus early-on have seen infection rates decline. Missteps in handling the virus include advising the public initially not to wear masks, advising those who donâ€™t exhibit symptoms to not get tested and continued shortages of supplies and testing backlogs. Seven months into the pandemic, the U.S. has still not streamlined its testing efforts as have countries praised for their virus response including South Korea and Germany.
 
 Trump says a vaccine will be ready by yearâ€™s end
 
 Vaccines typically take many years to develop, in part because they must be proven to be extremely safe because theyâ€™re given to healthy people. But around the world, governments, pharmaceutical companies and researchers have sought to expedite that process for the coronavirus. There are currently more than 190 experimental coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization, 42 of which have entered human studies.
 
 Experimental shots from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) in partnership with BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: ), the University of Oxford with AstraZeneca (NYSE: ) Plc, and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) Inc. are among the vanguard. Pfizer is looking to file an application by late November. Moderna expects interim results in November and, if positive, an emergency use authorization in December.
 
 Unfortunately, both Astrazeneca (LON: ) and Johnson & Johnson had to pause their vaccine trials due to adverse health effects.
 
 Importantly, once a vaccine is approved itâ€™s a challenge to get it widely distributed. Estimates from top health officials have ranged from the end of March to the end of 2021 before most Americans would have access to it. Trump has said that an assertion by Robert Redfield, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that disbursement of the vaccine would come some time in late spring or summer of next year was â€œa mistake.â€
 
 Redfield isnâ€™t the only top U.S. health official offering a less ambitious forecasts for getting a Covid-19 vaccine out to the public. Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, said it would probably be widely available by the end of March. And Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, forecast a timeline similar to Redfieldâ€™s in an interview with Bloomberg Television.

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) said on Friday its coronavirus vaccine deal with Oxford University will allow it to add up to 20% of manufacturing costs to cover additional expenses required to be incurred by the British drugmaker.
 
 ""In addition to the manufacturing costs, the company is incurring costs in excess of $1 billion globally that include clinical development, regulatory, distribution, pharmacovigilance and other expenses"", an AstraZeneca spokesman said in a statement.
 
 ""To cover these additional expenses, the company will add an amount equivalent to a maximum of 20% of the manufacturing costs to ensure there is no material impact on its finances this year while continuing efforts to provide the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic,"" the statement added.
 
 AstraZeneca has previously signed multiple supply-and-manufacture deals for more than 3 billion doses globally.
 
 These agreements are with companies and governments as the company gets closer to reporting early results of a late-stage clinical trial. Developed by the University of Oxford and licensed to AstraZeneca in April, the vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to secure regulatory approval.
 
 The company had said earlier it has created multiple supply chains to ensure that access to its vaccine is timely, broad and equitable for high- and low-income countries alike.
 
 Pricing and supply of experimental COVID-19 vaccines have been widely debated as richer countries pump billions of dollars into funding, and AstraZeneca has also been granted protection from future liability claims.
 
 Separately, AstraZeneca resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, the company said on Friday.",Â Reuters    UK100 203 Add toRemove from a Portfolio

 MILAN (Reuters) - European leaders warned of difficult months ahead as the resurgent COVID-19 pandemic forced authorities to impose new restrictions to try to curb the spread of the disease.
 
 Word that a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) produced immune responses in both elderly and young people offered some positive news.
 
 However, British Health Secretary Matt Hancock cautioned that the vaccine would not be widely available until next year and said ""we're not there yet"".
 
 Elsewhere the picture was unrelentingly grim as a string of countries reported record increases, led by France, which posted more than 50,000 daily cases for the first time on Sunday, while the continent passed the threshold of 250,000 deaths.
 
 Governments have been desperate to avoid the lockdowns which curbed the disease at the start of the year at the cost of shutting down their entire economies. But the steady rise in new cases has forced them to ratchet up controls steadily.
 
 ""We are facing very, very difficult months ahead,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a meeting of leaders from her Christian Democrat party, according to daily Bild.
 
 Although Germany has fared relatively well compared to other countries in Europe, it too has seen a sharp rise in cases and the closely watched Ifo business climate index fell on Monday, reflecting the worries over the virus.
 
 The gloom around the resurgent virus weighed on financial markets, where oil prices dropped on concerns of another slide in demand and stock markets also fell.
 
 In Spain, which has had more than 1 million cases of the disease, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned the country was facing an ""extreme"" situation as he announced a new state of emergency on Sunday, imposing local nighttime curfews and banning travel between regions in some cases.
 
 Italy, the country worst hit in the early stages of the crisis in March, also imposed new curbs, ordering restaurants and bars to close from 6 p.m. and shutting down cinemas, and gyms and imposing local curfews in several regions.

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) said on Friday it would sell commercial rights for two of its drugs to a German pharmaceutical company for $400 million as the British drugmaker looks to focus on newer medicines in new therapy areas.
 
 AstraZeneca said it would sell rights for its heart failure and blood pressure medicines Atacand and Atacand Plus to Germany's Cheplapharm Arzneimittel GmbH.
 
 AstraZeneca, which is among the front-runners in the race to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, has been trying to focus on its cancer drug portfolio in a bid to streamline its business.
 
 The agreement with Cheplapharm supports AstraZeneca's strategy of focusing on newer medicines in main therapy areas, the drugmaker said.
 
 The London-listed company has been seen as having a head start in the race for cancer treatments and sales of those medicines, including blockbuster lung cancer drug Imfinzi, have been key to its turnaround.
 
 Cheplapharm, which has held the European rights for Atacand and Atacand Plus since 2018, will now be allowed to sell them in around 70 countries.
 
 Atacand is a prescription drug approved to treat heart failure and hypertension, while Atacand Plus is used for hypertension.
 
 The transaction, expected to close in the fourth quarter, will not impact its 2020 financial forecast, AstraZeneca said.
 
 The company said $250 million of the $400 million consideration will be payable on deal completion, with the remainder in the first half of 2021.
 
 AstraZeneca will manufacture and supply both the medicines and commercialise them during a three-year transition period, the company said.
 
 Last year, AstraZeneca sold global commercial rights for its drug to treat acid reflux to Cheplapharm for up to $276 million.

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has struck a deal to initially pay less for Pfizer 's (N: ) COVID-19 vaccine candidate than the United States, an EU official told Reuters as the bloc announced on Wednesday it had secured an agreement for up to 300 million doses.
 
 The experimental drug, developed in conjunction with Germany's BioNTech (DE: ), is the frontrunner in a global race to produce a vaccine, with interim data released on Monday showing it was more than 90% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 in a large-scale clinical trial..
 
 Under the EU deal, 27 European countries could buy 200 million doses, and have an option to purchase another 100 million.
 
 The bloc will pay less than $19.50 per shot, a senior EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters, adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug's development.
 
 The official requested anonymity as the terms of the agreement are confidential.
 
 The United States agreed to pay $19.50 per shot for 100 million doses, a smaller volume than the EU. But it has an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately, and the price it will pay is unclear.
 
 BioNTech signalled this week that order size would impact the per-dose price in the developed world and said it would differentiate pricing between countries or regions for its potential vaccine.
 
 The EU official said the EU had agreed a price that was closer to $20 than to $10 but declined to give a precise figure.
 
 Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment on the pricing. A spokesman for the EU Commission, which negotiates vaccine agreements on behalf of EU states, also declined to comment.
 
 In June, the European Investment Bank, the EU's financial arm, granted a 100-million-euro ($118 million) loan to BioNTech for the development and manufacturing of its COVID-19 vaccine, which was followed in September by another 375-million-euro funding by Germany's research ministry.
 
 ""With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio, most of them in advanced trials phase,"" the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said, announcing the Pfizer deal.
 
 The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca (L: ), Sanofi (PA: ) and Johnson & Johnson (N: ) for their experimental COVID-19 shots, and is talking with Moderna (O: ), CureVac (DE: ) and Novavax (O: ) to secure their vaccines.
 
 Under the EU's deals with vaccine makers, the bloc offers a non-refundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a pre-agreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator.
 
 The Commission did not disclose the down payment made to Pfizer and BioNTech.
 
 'NO COPY PASTE' ON LIABILITY TERMS
 
 The prices agreed by the EU in previous deals with vaccine makers have partly been influenced by liability terms, which could cause large additional legal costs if inoculated people developed unexpected conditions because of the shots.
 
 Asked about liability clauses in the Pfizer contract, which have been a bone of contention between EU negotiators and drugmakers, the EU official said conditions were different from those the EU agreed with other companies, and also different from those Pfizer had with the U.S. government.
 
 There was ""no copy paste"" on liability terms from previous contracts, the official said.
 
 French drugmaker Sanofi, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline (L: ) as a partner, has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros ($11.8) per dose and did not get any liability waiver, while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 2.5 euro per dose, an official told Reuters in September.
 
 Bad side-effects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed.

 LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Chief Economist Andy Haldane has signed up to judge the winner of a 'war game' designed to help firms find alternatives to mass layoffs in the face of a coronavirus-driven slowdown.
 
 Confronted with the most unpredictable pandemic in memory, cost-conscious firms have already axed millions of staff worldwide, while UK redundancies hit a record high of 314,000 in the quarter to Sept. 30, official data showed on Tuesday.
 
 Unilever-owned (AS: ) tech firm uFlexReward created the COVID-19 War Game to allow executives to explore the impact of huge job cuts on their future earnings prospects.
 
 ""Many companies across the UK are facing financial strains as a result of the COVID crisis,"" Haldane told Reuters.
 
 ""Simulation tools can help us understand how best to alleviate these strains while preserving jobs, in a way that helps both businesses when making difficult commercial decisions and policymakers when making difficult economic decisions.""
 
 The game, designed during Britain's first lockdown this year and available free to play on the uFlexReward website, calls on players to devise a strategy to cut people costs of a fictional firm by 20%.
 
 Participants weigh up the pros and cons of large-scale redundancies versus alternatives, for the long-term benefit of the firm as well as the broader economy.
 
 It collates staff salaries, pensions, bonuses and share awards into one real-time cost-base, helping players see different ways of trimming overheads more clearly.
 
 This can include making lots of smaller cost cuts in a so-called 'broad-front' approach, rather than one large saving in more focused cuts like scrapping entire business units or the staff bonus pool.
 
 Financial firms have historically slashed highly paid workforces on the eve of recession, only to rehire rapidly when the economy rebounds.
 
 Swapping this convention for a broad-front approach could minimise the risks that employers end up understaffed and under-skilled when the recovery kicks off, uFlexReward Chief Executive Ken Charman said.
 
 'CHANGE IS COMING'
 
 Employers in multiple sectors are facing the prospect of a broader revolution in the world of work, triggered by technology and mass remote working.
 
 ""We are still stuck in a very Victorian view of what work is - with fixed working days, for a single employer and in a typically narrow role,"" Charman said.
 
 ""But change is coming that will allow people to be several things at once ... if companies lose people who are highly trained, experienced and loyal, they won't get them back,"" he said.
 
 Charman hopes the game might persuade employers to waive or cut dividends as well as executive pay increases, and offer job-sharing, reduced hours or part-time roles with flexibility to work elsewhere to staff who might otherwise end up unemployed.
 
 Pushing through alternatives to mass layoffs will require strong leadership and communication, particularly when thousands of employee contracts need to be renegotiated, but retaining staff could leave firms better placed when the recovery begins, Charman said.

EU official told Reuters as the bloc announced on Wednesday it had secured an agreement for up to 300 million doses    The experimental drug developed in conjunction with Germany's BioNTech DE  is the frontrunner in a global race to produce a vaccine with interim data released on Monday showing it was more than 90 effective at protecting people from COVID19 in a largescale clinical trial    Under the EU deal 27 European countries could buy 200 million doses and have an option to purchase another 100 million    The bloc will pay less than 1950 per shot a senior EU official involved in talks with vaccine makers told Reuters adding that partly reflected the financial support given by the EU and Germany for the drug's development    The official requested anonymity as the terms of the agreement are confidential    The United States agreed to pay 1950 per shot for 100 million doses a smaller volume than the EU But it has an option to buy a further 500 million under terms to be negotiated separately and the price it will pay is unclear    BioNTech signalled this week that order size would impact the perdose price in the developed world and said it would differentiate pricing between countries or regions for its potential vaccine    The EU official said the EU had agreed a price that was closer to 20 than to 10 but declined to give a precise figure    Pfizer and BioNTech declined to comment on the pricing A spokesman for the EU Commission which negotiates vaccine agreements on behalf of EU states also declined to comment    In June the European Investment Bank the EU's financial arm granted a 100millioneuro 118 million loan to BioNTech for the development and manufacturing of its COVID19 vaccine which was followed in September by another 375millioneuro funding by Germany's research ministry    With this fourth contract we are now consolidating an extremely solid vaccine candidate portfolio most of them in advanced trials phase the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said announcing the Pfizer deal    The EU has already signed supply deals with AstraZeneca L  Sanofi PA  and Johnson  Johnson N  for their experimental COVID19 shots and is talking with Moderna O  CureVac DE  and Novavax O  to secure their vaccines    Under the EU's deals with vaccine makers the bloc offers a nonrefundable down payment to companies in exchange for the right to book doses which EU states could buy at a preagreed price if the vaccine is approved as effective and safe by the EU drug regulator    The Commission did not disclose the down payment made to Pfizer and BioNTech    'NO COPY PASTE' ON LIABILITY TERMS    The prices agreed by the EU in previous deals with vaccine makers have partly been influenced by liability terms which could cause large additional legal costs if inoculated people developed unexpected conditions because of the shots    Asked about liability clauses in the Pfizer contract which have been a bone of contention between EU negotiators and drugmakers the EU official said conditions were different from those the EU agreed with other companies and also different from those Pfizer had with the US government    There was no copy paste on liability terms from previous contracts the official said    French drugmaker Sanofi which is working with GlaxoSmithKline L  as a partner has agreed with the EU a price of about 10 euros 118 per dose and did not get any liability waiver while AstraZeneca would pay claims only up to a certain threshold if something goes wrong with its vaccine in exchange for a price of 25 euro per dose an official told Reuters in September    Bad sideeffects after a vaccine is approved are rare but are considered more likely in this emergency because of the unprecedented speed with which vaccines are being developed    The United States has granted immunity from liability for COVID19 vaccines that receive regulatory approval 22 Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A woman uses a computer

alternatives to mass layoffs in the face of a coronavirusdriven slowdown    Confronted with the most unpredictable pandemic in memory costconscious firms have already axed millions of staff worldwide while UK redundancies hit a record high of 314000 in the quarter to Sept 30 official data showed on Tuesday    Unileverowned AS  tech firm uFlexReward created the COVID19 War Game to allow executives to explore the impact of huge job cuts on their future earnings prospects    Many companies across the UK are facing financial strains as a result of the COVID crisis Haldane told Reuters    Simulation tools can help us understand how best to alleviate these strains while preserving jobs in a way that helps both businesses when making difficult commercial decisions and policymakers when making difficult economic decisions    The game designed during Britain's first lockdown this year and available free to play on the uFlexReward website calls on players to devise a strategy to cut people costs of a fictional firm by 20    Participants weigh up the pros and cons of largescale redundancies versus alternatives for the longterm benefit of the firm as well as the broader economy    It collates staff salaries pensions bonuses and share awards into one realtime costbase helping players see different ways of trimming overheads more clearly    This can include making lots of smaller cost cuts in a socalled 'broadfront' approach rather than one large saving in more focused cuts like scrapping entire business units or the staff bonus pool    Financial firms have historically slashed highly paid workforces on the eve of recession only to rehire rapidly when the economy rebounds    Swapping this convention for a broadfront approach could minimise the risks that employers end up understaffed and underskilled when the recovery kicks off uFlexReward Chief Executive Ken Charman said    'CHANGE IS COMING'    Employers in multiple sectors are facing the prospect of a broader revolution in the world of work triggered by technology and mass remote working    We are still stuck in a very Victorian view of what work is  with fixed working days for a single employer and in a typically narrow role Charman said    But change is coming that will allow people to be several things at once  if companies lose people who are highly trained experienced and loyal they won't get them back he said    Charman hopes the game might persuade employers to waive or cut dividends as well as executive pay increases and offer jobsharing reduced hours or parttime roles with flexibility to work elsewhere to staff who might otherwise end up unemployed    Pushing through alternatives to mass layoffs will require strong leadership and communication particularly when thousands of employee contracts need to be renegotiated but retaining staff could leave firms better placed when the recovery begins Charman said    Executives need to be willing to abandon the old

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has struck a deal for up 405 million doses of German biotech firm CureVac's (DE: ) potential COVID-19 vaccine, the head of the EU executive said on Monday, taking total supplies secured by the bloc to nearly 2 billion doses.
 
 The deal with CureVac follows EU supply agreements with AstraZeneca (L: ), Johnson & Johnson (N: ), Sanofi (PA: ), and Pfizer (N: ) for a combined 1.4 billion doses of their potential vaccines.
 
 ""I am glad to announce a new agreement to buy up to 405 million doses of a vaccine produced by the European company CureVac,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding the contract was negotiated after EU funding to the company to develop its vaccine.
 
 The EU, with a population of about 450 million, has been in talks with CureVac for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine at least since July, an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows, confirming an exclusive Reuters report.
 
 The deal will be authorised by the Commission on Tuesday, von der Leyen said, while the actual signature will take place some days later.
 
 Under advance purchase agreements negotiated by the EU during the pandemic, the bloc makes a non-refundable down payment to a vaccine maker to secure a certain number of doses for an agreed price, which will then be paid by EU states willing to buy the shot only after it is authorised as safe and effective by the EU drugs regulator.
 
 The price agreed for the vaccine has not been disclosed.
 
 The deal will initially cover 225 million doses, with an option to buy another 180 million.
 
 CureVac was not immediately available for comment.
 
 The Commission president also said she hoped to finalise a deal soon with Moderna (O: ) for its COVID-19 vaccine, which on Monday announced positive interim results from large-scale clinical trials.

 MILAN (Reuters) - Shares in Pfizer (N: ) fell on Monday after rival drugmaker Moderna (O: ) said its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was 94.5% effective and that it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures.
 
 Moderna is the second U.S. company to report encouraging trial results on a COVID-19 vaccine, joining Pfizer (N: ) which has said its vaccine is also more than 90% effective.
 
 But while Pfizer's vaccine has to be stored and shipped at ultra-cool temperatures, Moderna said its product can be kept at normal fridge temperatures.
 
 ""This is very important, perhaps a game changer,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarkets.
 
 ""The Pfizer vaccine had to be kept in very cold temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius, making it logistically difficult to produce and transport large doses of the vaccine,"" he said.
 
 Pfizer shares, which on Nov. 9 hit their highest levels since end July 2019, fell 4.1% by 1623 GMT, while shares in its German partner BioNTech were down 12.8%.
 
 JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts said the logistics of Moderna's vaccine were clearly less onerous although they expect storage requirements for both the vaccines to converge.
 
 Moderna shares were up 9% after hitting a record high earlier on Monday, while shares in British drugmaker AstraZeneca (L: ), which is yet to release results from its late-stage vaccine trials, were down 0.9%.",22 Â Reuters FILE PHOTO Employee Philipp Hoffmann of German biopharmaceutical company CureVac demonstrates research workflow on a vaccine for the coronavirus COVID19 disease at a laboratory in Tuebingen 22    SASY 055 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio PFE 140 Add toRemove from a Portfolio JNJ 045 Add toRemove from a Portfolio MRNA 740 Add toRemove from a Portfolio CVAC 315 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    By Francesco Guarascio    BRUSSELS Reuters  The European Union has struck a deal for up 405 million doses of German biotech firm CureVac's DE  potential COVID19 vaccine the head of the EU executive said on Monday taking total supplies secured by the bloc to nearly 2 billion doses    The deal with CureVac follows EU supply agreements with AstraZeneca L  Johnson  Johnson N  Sanofi PA  and Pfizer N  for a combined 14 billion doses of their potential vaccines    I am glad to announce a new agreement to buy up to 405 million doses of a vaccine produced by the European company CureVac European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said adding the contract was negotiated after EU funding to the company to develop its vaccine    The EU with a population of about 450 million has been in talks with CureVac for its experimental COVID19 vaccine at least since July an internal EU document seen by Reuters shows confirming an exclusive Reuters report    The deal will be authorised by the Commission on Tuesday von der Leyen said while the actual signature will take place some days later    Under advance purchase agreements negotiated by the EU during the pandemic the bloc makes a nonrefundable down payment to a vaccine maker to secure a certain number of doses for an agreed price which will then be paid by EU states willing to buy the shot only after it is authorised as safe and effective by the EU drugs regulator    The price agreed for the vaccine has not been disclosed    The deal will initially cover 225 million doses with an option to buy another 180 million    CureVac was not immediately available for comment    The Commission president also said she hoped to finalise a deal soon with Moderna O  for its COVID19 vaccine which on Monday announced positive interim results from largescale clinical trials    CureVac's approach is based on socalled messenger RNA mRNA pieces of genetic code that prompt human cells to produce therapeutic proteins  the same technology used by Moderna and also PfizerBioNTech the other major potential vaccine to have reported positive latestage trial results Â Reuters The Pfizer logo is seen at their UK commercial headquarters in Walton Oaks    JPM 274 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio PFE 140 Add toRemove from a Portfolio MRNA 740 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    By Danilo Masoni    MILAN Reuters  Shares in Pfizer N  fell on Monday after rival drugmaker Moderna O  said its experimental vaccine against COVID19 was 945 effective and that it can be stored at normal fridge temperatures    Moderna is the second US company to report encouraging trial results on a COVID19 vaccine joining Pfizer N  which has said its vaccine is also more than 90 effective    But while Pfizer's vaccine has to be stored and shipped at ultracool temperatures Moderna said its product can be kept at normal fridge temperatures    This is very important perhaps a game changer said Fawad Razaqzada analyst at ThinkMarkets    The Pfizer vaccine had to be kept in very cold temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius making it logistically difficult to produce and transport large doses of the vaccine he said    Pfizer shares which on Nov 9 hit their highest levels since end July 2019 fell 41 by 1623 GMT while shares in its German partner BioNTech were down 128    JPMorgan NYSE  analysts said the logistics of Moderna's vaccine were clearly less onerous although they expect storage requirements for both the vaccines to converge    Moderna shares were up 9 after hitting a record high earlier on Monday while shares in British drugmaker AstraZeneca L  which is yet to release results from its latestage vaccine trials were down 09,0.43368125701459026,0.06803050344717011

 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (N: ) and BioNTech (O: ) could secure emergency U.S. and European authorization for their COVID-19 vaccine next month after final trial results showed it had a 95% success rate and no serious side effects, the drugmakers said on Wednesday.
 
 The efficacy of the shot was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities - a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately affected the elderly and certain groups including Black people.
 
 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration could grant emergency-use approval towards the end of the first half of December or early in the second half, BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV. Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December, he added.
 
 ""If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas, but really only if all goes positively,"" he said.
 
 The success rate of the vaccine developed by U.S. firm Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech is the highest of any candidate in late-stage clinical trials so far, and experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic.
 
 Pfizer said 170 volunteers in its trial involving over 43,000 people contracted COVID-19 but 162 of them had only been given a placebo, meaning the vaccine was 95% effective. Of the 10 people who had severe COVID-19, one had received the vaccine.
 
 ""A first in the history of mankind: less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the large-scale clinical trial of a vaccine, moreover based on a whole new technique,"" said Enrico Bucci, a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""Today is a special day.""
 
 BioNTech's Sahin said the U.S. emergency authorization would be applied for on Friday.
 
 The FDA committee tentatively plans to meet on Dec. 8-10, a source familiar with the situation said, though the dates could still change. The FDA did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 COVID-19 RUNS RAMPANT
 
 The final trial analysis comes a week after initial results showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc (O: ) released preliminary data for its vaccine on Monday, showing 94.5% effectiveness.
 
 The better-than-expected results from the two vaccines, both developed with new messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, have raised hopes for an end to a pandemic that has killed more than 1.3 million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life.
 
 The Pfizer-BioNTech shot was found to have 94% efficacy in people over 65 years, which experts said was crucial at a time when COVID-19 is running rampant around the world with record numbers of new cases and hospitalizations.
 
 ""This is the evidence we needed to ensure that the most vulnerable people are protected,"" said Andrew Hill, senior visiting research fellow at the University of Liverpool's department of pharmacology.
 
 Global shares rose as the trial results countered concerns around the stubbornly high global infection rate. Pfizer shares were up 1.6% while BioNTech jumped 3.8% in the United States. By contrast, Moderna dropped 4.2%.
 
 Investors have treated vaccine development as a race between companies, although there is likely to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future.
 
 DISTRIBUTING SHOTS
 
 Pfizer says it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year, enough to protect 25 million people, and then produce up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.
 
 While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations this year, it will be months before large-scale rollouts begin in either country.
 
 Pfizer also has agreements with the European Union, Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year.
 
 Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization's top emergency expert, said it would be at least 4-6 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world.
 
 Distribution of a Pfizer-BioNTech shot is complicated by the need to store it at ultra-cold temperatures of -70 degrees Celsius. It can, however, be kept in a normal fridge for up to five days, or up to 15 days in a thermal shipping box.
 
 Moderna's vaccine can be stored for up to six months at -20C though it is expected to be stable for 30 days at normal fridge temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36Â°-46Â°F).
 
 FATIGUE AND HEADACHES
 
 Pfizer said its two-dose vaccine, called BNT162b2, was well-tolerated and that side effects were mostly mild to moderate, and cleared up quickly.
 
 It said the only severe adverse events experienced by volunteers were fatigue and headaches. Out of 8,000 participants, 2% had headaches after the second dose while 3.8% experienced fatigue. Older adults tended to report fewer and milder adverse events.
 
 ""These are extraordinary results, and the safety data look good,"" said David Spiegelhalter, a professor and expert in risk and evidence communication at the University of Cambridge.
 
 ""It would be interesting to see what adverse reactions were reported by the group getting the placebo, since that gives an idea of how much of the adverse effects are due to the vaccination process, and how much is due to the vaccine itself.""
 
 Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, the next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson says it is on track to deliver data this year.

 Of the dozens of drugmakers and research groups racing to develop vaccines against COVID-19, the next data release will likely be from AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) with the University of Oxford in November or December. Johnson & Johnson says it is on track to deliver data this year.

success rate and no serious side effects the drugmakers said on Wednesday    The efficacy of the shot was found to be consistent across different ages and ethnicities  a promising sign given the disease has disproportionately affected the elderly and certain groups including Black people    The US Food and Drug Administration could grant emergencyuse approval towards the end of the first half of December or early in the second half BioNTech Chief Executive Ugur Sahin told Reuters TV Conditional approval in the European Union could be secured in the second half of December he added    If all goes well I could imagine that we gain approval in the second half of December and start deliveries before Christmas but really only if all goes positively he said    The success rate of the vaccine developed by US firm Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech is the highest of any candidate in latestage clinical trials so far and experts said it was a significant achievement in the race to end the pandemic    Pfizer said 170 volunteers in its trial involving over 43000 people contracted COVID19 but 162 of them had only been given a placebo meaning the vaccine was 95 effective Of the 10 people who had severe COVID19 one had received the vaccine    A first in the history of mankind less than a year from the sequence of the virus to the largescale clinical trial of a vaccine moreover based on a whole new technique said Enrico Bucci a biologist at Temple University in Philadelphia Today is a special day    BioNTech's Sahin said the US emergency authorization would be applied for on Friday

million people and wreaked havoc upon economies and daily life    The PfizerBioNTech shot was found to have 94 efficacy in people over 65 years which experts said was crucial at a time when COVID19 is

to be global demand for as much vaccine as can be produced for the foreseeable future    DISTRIBUTING SHOTS    Pfizer says it expects to make as many as 50 million vaccine doses this year enough to protect 25 million people and then produce up to 13 billion doses in 2021    While some groups such as healthcare workers will be prioritized in the United States and Britain for vaccinations this year it will be months before largescale rollouts begin in either country    Pfizer also has agreements with the European Union Germany and Japan where distribution could begin next year    Mike Ryan the World Health Organization's top emergency expert said it would be at least 46 months before significant levels of vaccination were taking place around the world    Distribution of a PfizerBioNTech

 LONDON (Reuters) - English doctors are grappling with the prospect of seven-day service, -75 degree Celsius freezers and vaccines known as ""Talent"" and ""Courageous"" as they prepare for an unprecedented logistical challenge: the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccinations.
 
 Health minister Matt Hancock has set a target for England's National Health Service that it should be ready to administer vaccines by Dec. 1, although he has said his central expectation is for the bulk of the roll-out to happen next year.
 
 Any distribution of vaccines would also require approval from the country's medical watchdog, the MHRA.
 
 On Wednesday, NHS England medical director Stephen Powis confirmed that general practitioners (GPs), pharmacies and large-scale inoculation centres could all be involved in the vaccine roll-out, adding more details would be given in the coming days.
 
 ""There's going to be some nationally organised vaccine immunisation centres, which will be large centres, probably run with military involved, etc. But GPs are well placed,"" Steve Mowle, a practising GP and honorary treasurer of the Royal College of General Practitioners, told Reuters.
 
 ""The challenge of this task is even bigger than the flu immunisation programme. But I'm sure that GPs will have a very central role in delivering the COVID-19 vaccine.""
 
 Germany is scouting trade fair halls and airport terminals as possible mass vaccination centres, while Italy plans to lean on its existing GP network. But in many countries, details of how the population will be inoculated are scarce.
 
 A spokesman for Britain's health ministry said that extra logistical expertise, transport arrangements and equipment had been put in place, the workforce had been expanded and 150 million pounds had been given to GP practices.
 
 ""An enormous amount of planning has taken place to ensure our health service stands ready to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine,"" he said.
 
 ""We will publish further details on our deployment plans in due course.""
 
 'TALENT' AND 'COURAGEOUS'
 
 Although there is still a lack of clarity over some of the details of how doctors are expected to deliver the vaccines, they have been briefed on the broad outlines.
 
 In the absence of trade names, the NHS uses codenames to refer to the two vaccine candidates that are expected to be the first available.
 
 Pfizer (N: ) and BioNTech's vaccine candidate, which uses an mRNA platform, is referred to as ""Courageous vaccine"", while the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca's (L: ) is referred to as ""Talent vaccine"" in slides from a webinar to health professionals given by NHS England last week that have been reviewed by Reuters.
 
 Britain has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine candidate, which had 95% efficacy in final trial results published on Wednesday, and 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca shot, which is expected to publish efficacy data in coming weeks.
 
 In the webinar, doctors were told there would be 975 doses per pack of Pfizer vaccine, with two doses needed to be given 21 days apart, in line with the U.S. drugmaker's design specifications.
 
 Clinics could also need to be open at weekends to make sure the doses are used in time.
 
 ""Potential COVID-19 vaccines could need to be delivered within a certain time period once they arrive at a site,"" the slide said.
 
 ""So, if necessary, but not otherwise, practices will need to have the ability to deliver vaccinations between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. seven days a week to avoid any going to waste.""
 
 TWIN TRACK
 
 The urgency of getting vaccines delivered to people promptly after they are received stems in part from the demanding storage requirements of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs to be kept at around -75 degrees Celsius.
 
 It can then be stored for five days in refrigeration but once diluted it has to be used within a matter of hours, which causes headaches for those distributing the vaccine, especially in rural areas.
 
 ""There's some real challenges around how, how it might be used,"" Richard Vautrey, a doctor and chair of the British Medical Association's GP Committee, said.
 
 ""It's quite different from what we would normally experience with, say, the flu vaccine,"" he said, adding that details of the ""twin track"" strategy were under active discussion.
 
 The onerous storage requirements of the Pfizer vaccine can be mitigated by dry ice and other temporary cooling solutions, said Anna Blakney, research fellow at Imperial College London.
 
 ""Between the purchase of new freezers and having that space, in addition to the dry ice shipments, that would probably be able to accommodate ... all the vaccines that we'd be receiving,"" she said.
 
 Much of the delivery of vaccines will be determined at a local level, and exact practices may vary in different parts of England, let alone in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, where health policy is devolved.
 
 In the central English county of Nottinghamshire, health officials said in a briefing to medical professionals that they planned to be ready to start vaccinating front-line staff and people in care homes from Dec. 9, with large-scale COVID vaccine centres operating from Jan. 2 and more GP practice involvement from mid-January.
 
 ""I don't think we'll be at full capacity from the first of December. Obviously, we will have a gradual roll-out,"" Mowle said.
 
 ""But... where there's a will there's a way, and I think there's a huge willingness of GPs to engage in this process.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/world-news/where-theres-a-will-theres-a-way-as-english-doctors-prepare-covid-vaccine-rollout-2253132,0.021,0.9,0.08,0.9944,"3/3 Â© Reuters.

 LONDON (Reuters) - Results of late-stage trials of University of Oxford's COVID-19 vaccine candidate should definitely be known by Christmas, the chief investigator on the study said on Thursday, adding it was too early to know its efficacy yet.
 
 Asked if it was too early to say whether the vaccine, which is licensed to AstraZeneca (L: ), stops disease developing, Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: ""We haven't quite got to that point yet. We're obviously not going to rush that.""
 
 ""We're getting close, and it's definitely going to be before Christmas, based on the progress,"" he told BBC Radio when asked when the trial investigators would be unblinded to efficacy data and results released.

 LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca and Oxford University's potential COVID-19 vaccine produced a strong immune response in older adults, data published on Thursday showed, with researchers expecting to release late-stage trial results by Christmas.
 
 The data, reported in part last month but published in full in The Lancet medical journal on Thursday, suggest that those aged over 70, who are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19, could build robust immunity.
 
 ""The robust antibody and T-cell responses seen in older people in our study are encouraging,"" said Maheshi Ramasamy, a consultant and co-lead investigator at the Oxford Vaccine Group.
 
 ""We hope that this means our vaccine will help to protect some of the most vulnerable people in society, but further research will be needed before we can be sure.""
 
 Late-stage, or Phase III, trials are ongoing to confirm the findings, researchers said, and to test whether the vaccine protects against infection with SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of people, including people with underlying health conditions.
 
 Results of those trials should definitely be known by Christmas, the Oxford Vaccine Group's director, Andrew Pollard, said, adding it was too early to know whether and how well the vaccine works in preventing COVID-19 disease.
 
 ""We're still waiting to get to the point where we can do the analysis to just work out how well the vaccine can protect people, and we're getting ever closer to that,"" he told journalists.
 
 ""We are optimistic that we'll be able to do that before Christmas, and obviously we'll share that with you as soon as we can at that point.""
 
 The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine candidate, called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, had been among the front-runners in global efforts to develop shots to protect against infection with the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2.
 
 But rival drugmakers Pfizer Inc (N: ), BioNTech (F: ) and Moderna Inc (O: ) have in the past 10 days edged ahead, releasing data from late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials that shows more than 90% efficacy.
 
 ""We're not in a rush. We and it's not a competition with the other developers,"" Oxford's Pollard said, adding that AstraZeneca would release headline efficacy data before it was published in an academic journal.
 
 Oxford University has set a target of 53 infections to start the interim analysis of its late-stage trial results, though ""lots of cases"" in its trial arms in Britain, South Africa and Brazil mean the exact number of infections reported could differ.
 
 Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots, both of which use new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), AstraZeneca's is a viral vector vaccine made from a weakened version of a common cold virus found in chimpanzees.
 
 The Phase II trial reported in The Lancet involved a total of 560 healthy volunteers, with 160 aged 18-55, 160 aged 56-69, and 240 aged 70 or over.
 
 Volunteers got two doses of the vaccine or a placebo, and no serious side effects related to the AZD1222 vaccine were reported, the researchers said.
 
 AstraZeneca (L: ) has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and governments around the world.

 Investing.com - The Dow slipped Thursday, as investors weighed up strength in tech against weakness in value amid concerns over the economy on signs of a slowdown in the labor market and surging Covid-19 cases.
 
 The fell 0.28%, or 83 points. The was down 0.10%, while the rose 0.5%.
 
 The Labor Department reported that 742,000 people filed for unemployment insurance in the week ended November 14, up 31,000 from the prior week, above economists' forecasts for 707,000 claims.
 
 Signs of weakness in the labor market will likely continue in the weeks ahead as the surge in the virus prompts further parts of the U.S. to impose restrictions to curb the virus.
 
 ""Overall, the back-up in claims this week is somewhat troubling, and likely indicative of what we are going to see in the next few weeks ahead,"" Jefferies (NYSE: ) Thomas Simons.
 
 The U.S. reported a daily record of 1,900 deaths on Wednesday, official health data showed, with the hospitalizations from the virus nationwide hitting another record. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against travel ahead of Thanksgiving next week.
 
 Value stocks like financials, energy, and industrials fell into the red.
 
 Still, there was further optimism on the vaccine front after AstraZeneca PLC (LON: )said its coronavirus vaccine had shown signs of strong immune responses among older adults.
 
 Consumer discretionary stocks, meanwhile, received a boost from a surge in L Brands.
 
 L Brands (NYSE: ) rallied 16% following earnings that topped analyst estimates, underpinned by strong results at Bath & Body Works amid pandemic-fueled demand for soap and hand sanitizer.
 
 Macyâ€™s (NYSE: ) reported better-than-expected earnings, but same-store sales fell short of estimates, sending its shares into the red.
 
 Tech, however, remained above the flatline as the Fab 5 traded mostly higher.
 
 Amazon.com (NASDAQ: ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), Microsoft (NASDAQ: ), traded higher, while Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Facebook (NASDAQ: ) were marginally lower.

 Investing.com -- Germany extends its lockdown restrictions through December 20th â€“ but doesnâ€™t tighten them much despite failing to bring down its infection curve. Consumer confidence in Europeâ€™s two biggest economies falls. corrects sharply downward, and corrects even more sharply. Salesforce is reported to be close to buying Slack and Exxon Mobil is gloomy on oil. Hereâ€™s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, November 26th.
 
 1. Germany extends restrictions - but doesn't tighten them much
 
 Germanyâ€™s federal and regional governments extended current restrictions on business and social gatherings until December 20 and expanded restrictions on mask-wearing, but otherwise shied away from tightening restrictions as it tries to bring its second wave of the coronavirus under control.
 
 Europeâ€™s largest economy reported a record-high 32,000 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, as well as over 300 deaths for the third straight day. Having implemented a less strict lockdown to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, it has so far failed to bring the virus under control. By contrast, France and the U.K. have started to relax their restrictions ahead, hoping to guarantee something closer to normal life by Christmas.
 
 Consumer sentiment surveys in both and both fell by more than expected in November, data released on Thursday showed.
 
 2. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) drug doubts
 
 Doubts are growing about the reliability of the data provided by AstraZeneca (LON: ) and the University of Oxford over the effectiveness of their experimental drug to fight the coronavirus.
 
 Moncef Slaoui, the head of the U.S. Operation Warp Speed team tasked with funding vaccine development, said on Wednesday that the subgroup which reported the highest degree of efficacy in the stage 2 trial data released last week had been restricted to people under 55, an age bracket that appears in any case to be more resistant to the disease, or at least its more severe manifestations.
 
 The test data had shown that the drug had prevented the disease in 62% of people who received two full doses of the vaccine, but 90% in those who received only a half dose to start with. The half-dose experiment started as a mistake but was extended for the sake of consistency.
 
 3. Stocks drift, Bitcoin slumps after rally
 
 Global stocks stayed in mostly positive territory before drifting into range trading as the U.S. Thanksgiving Holiday loomed large over the dayâ€™s proceedings.
 
 Weak consumer confidence data in France and Germany were marginally offset by stronger-than-expected credit growth figures from the European Central Bank, which is also due to release the accounts of its last policy meeting later.
 
 By 6:30 AM, the benchmark index was down less than 0.1%, while the index closed up 0.2%.
 
 There was a more violent correction in other markets, where Bitcoin gave up over 10% after an equally violent rally, while Ripple, another popular cryptocurrency, fell 22%.
 
 4. Salesforce talks to Slack
 
 Slack (NYSE: ) stock rose 36% on Wednesday to close near an all-time high on reports that it is in talks to be acquired by software giant Salesforce (NYSE: ).
 
 Marc Benioffâ€™s company could reach a deal for the office messaging software app within days, according to The Wall Street Journal, but itâ€™s unclear how any deal would be structured. Like many software companies, its valuation is far in excess of what its current financials would usually justify.
 
 For all its popularity, Slackâ€™s shares have failed to capitalize on the trend away from email in offices, and now faces an increasingly acute strategic challenge from Microsoftâ€™s Teams application.
 
 5 Oil steadies after rally; Exxon's gloomy forecasts
 
 Crude oil prices also retraced slightly but stayed close to their post-pandemic highs after some judicious profit-taking
 
 By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), U.S. futures were down 1.0% at $45.22 a barrel, while crude futures were down 0.9% at $48.09.
 
 The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Exxon Mobil (NYSE: ) had revised down its estimate of oil prices over the next six years by between 11% and 17%, indicating expectations of a prolonged impact on prices from the pandemic.
 
 Short-term pressures may also be building up, given a surprisingly strong build in U.S. last week, according to U.S. government data released on Wednesday.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/europe-confidence-slips-bitcoin-corrects-slack-talk--whats-up-in-markets-2257576,0.078,0.837,0.085,0.0514,"Â© Reuters.

 Investing.com-- AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) is in a race to develop an effective Covid-19 vaccine, but that's not it's only goal.
 
 It's really known as a global leader in cancer treatments, winning a number of drug approvals in recent years by regulators around the world.
 
 Earlier this week, the U.K.-based drug maker said late-stage trials of its Covid-19 vaccine showed 90% efficacy, but it quickly had to acknowledge flaws in the data.
 
 Investing.com's Geoffrey Smith and explains why this rare misstep won't cause lasting damage, while Peter Nurse says the fall-out has real reputational risks that will weigh on valuation.
 
 The Bull Case
 
 The bull case for AstraZeneca doesnâ€™t need any contribution from the experimental vaccine for Covid-19.
 
 The fact is that the company is a global powerhouse for oncology drugs and others that treat chronic diseases of the lungs and kidneys. It earns gross margins of 80% in a normal year and it expects its underlying earnings per share to grow by between 15% and 20% in 2020, a year when the worldâ€™s healthcare systems have had trouble finding resources for anything but treating Covid-19.
 
 It is, beyond any reasonable doubt, a well-run company, whose shares deserve a management premium. In barely seven years as CEO, Pascal Soriot had raised the market value of an already mature business by 150% when the pandemic erupted. Soriot has quickly addressed this weekâ€™s misstep over communicating stage 2 trial results by ordering a new trial, as any responsible CEO might.
 
 Global regulators have been pleased to approve a string of its drugs in recent years, and suggestions that this vital relationship will be damaged by an imperfect trial conducted under the extraordinary pressures of the current race for a Covid cure are alarmist.
 
 Barring a fiasco wholly out of character with the rest of Soriotâ€™s career, there is no downside risk for the share price even if the Covid-19 drug falls short. AstraZenecaâ€™s share price is almost exactly where it was at the start of the year, before anyone had even heard the dreaded C-word. Given that the cost of servicing its sizable debt pile has come down sharply since then (allowing a higher stock valuation, all other things being equal), you can even argue that the market is already applying a discount to the shares for the whole Covid-19 saga.
 
 Either the drug is a write-off, in which case much of the cost remains with the governments that have helped to fund its development, or it actually is effective, allowing worldwide distribution. In the latter case, the fact that it has agreed to provide the drug at no profit should not be seen as the bugbear that many investors consider it. Reports citing confidential contracts with manufacturers suggest that AZ will be able to exercise pricing power from the second half of next year already.
 
 And if it does eschew the short-term profit by keeping the price down, the long-term benefit could still be considerable. Cancer, its true specialism, is a rich country disease, so the spread of wealth across ever more parts of the world is a secular positive for it. The gain in goodwill from not price-gouging on the drug everyone wants and needs will be intangible, but immeasurable.
 
 The Bear Case
 
 The bear case surrounding AstraZeneca rests largely on valuation and on the reputational damage it may incur from the mess itâ€™s making of getting its coronavirus vaccine candidate approved.
 
 With a P/E ratio of around 55, the companyâ€™s stock is priced well above both the industry average and its historical norm, suggesting there is plenty of downside potential.
 
 The pharmaceutical giant released interim analysis of late-stage trials of its vaccine to great fanfare on Monday, stating that its efficacy reached a maximum of 90% depending on the dosage regime.
 
 However, doubts quickly emerged over the reliability of the data provided by AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, as regards the drugâ€™s effectiveness.
 
 Importantly, Moncef Slaoui, the head of the U.S. Operation Warp Speed team tasked with funding vaccine development, pointed out a potential flaw, saying the subgroup which reported the highest degree of efficacy had been restricted to people under 55, subjects which are likely to be more resistant to the disease.
 
 Geoffrey Porges, Director of Therapeutics Research at life sciences boutique investment bank SVB Leerink, has been widely reported as predicting that the vaccine will never be licensed in the U.S., particularly as there appear to be viable alternatives in the form of Pfizer Inc (NYSE: )â€™s and Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: )â€™s drugs. Promising candidate vaccines from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and others are still in the development pipeline.
 
 AstraZeneca had promised to supply its vaccine at cost price for as long as the pandemic lasts, so not making it into the valuable American market for this product may not necessarily be a big thing. But the botched communication of what was far too small a trial could be far more difficult to ignore, doing lasting damage to its relationship with the all-important Food & Drug Administration. After all, it generated almost $8 billion in revenue in the U.S. last year, its biggest single market by far.
 
 Swiss banking giant UBS earlier this week kept its â€œsellâ€ rating on AstraZeneca, citing the uncertainty surrounding its vaccineâ€™s results. Earlier this month it had also noted that product sales in emerging markets disappointed in the third quarter results, whereas U.S. business surprised positively. This balance may be about to change.

 Investing.com -- Black Friday is here, but the shopping season is likely to different with online sales likely to surge. European banking consolidation is put on hold in Spain, while AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) is unlikely to feel much love as Wall Street returns from its Thanksgiving holiday. Oil is trading mixed as a crucial OPEC+ meeting looms, while sterling retains strength and stocks are seen continuing the recent positive trend. Hereâ€™s what you need to know in financial markets on Friday, November 27th.
 
 1. Black Friday arrives, but with a difference
 
 Itâ€™s Black Friday, traditionally the busiest shopping day in the United States, but this being 2020, things are set to be different.
 
 Pictures of shoppers fighting to get into shops in the search for bargains have been the staple of news channels for years, but Covid-19 restrictions have forced shops to divert most purchases online.
 
 Many major retailers, hit hard by the pandemic, started offering their Black Friday promotions much earlier than usual, taking their lead from Amazon (NASDAQ: ) hosting their Prime Day in the middle of October, in order to capture as much holiday-related as possible.
 
 Itâ€™s still likely to be a bumper period for the major retailers, with the National Retail Federation forecasting U.S. holiday retail sales will increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019, for a total of $755.3 billion to $766.7 billion. This compares with an average annual increase of 3.5% over the past five years.
 
 2. BBVA (MC: ) and Sabadell (MC: ) end talks
 
 Banco Sabadell stock slumped 12% after its potential merger with rival BBVA collapsed, just two weeks after the two Spanish banks announced plans for a tie-up. The disagreement seems to center around the price of the deal, which would have resulted in a bank with a market capitalization of around 27.5 billion euros ($33 billion).
 
 BBVA, Spainâ€™s second-largest bank, said it was in no rush to scale up its operations given it already has around 15% of Spainâ€™s market share, while Sabadell said it would launch a new strategy to prioritise domestic business.
 
 European lenders have been under considerable pressure, with the financial challenges surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic adding to their woes. Consolidation of the regionâ€™s fragmented banking sector has been seen as a way forward, and even before this CaixaBank and Bankia had announced plans to merge in a deal that would create Spainâ€™s largest domestic bank, with a combined market capitalisation of almost â‚¬17 billion.
 
 3. Stocks seen higher; AstraZeneca in focus
 
 U.S. stocks are set to open higher Friday, although gains are likely to be limited with the market set to close early in the aftermath of the Thanksgiving Holiday.
 
 By 6:30 AM, the contract rose 62 points, or 0.2%, while traded 7 points, or 0.2%, higher, and climbed 46 points, or 0.4%.
 
 Generally positive coronavirus vaccine news and emerging political certainty in the U.S. have prompted strong gains on Wall Street, with the topping the 30,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.
 
 President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will leave office if the Electoral College votes for President-elect Joe Biden. This is the closest he has come to conceding the election, and adds to the feeling of normalcy returning to U.S. political circles.
 
 AstraZeneca (LON: ) will be in focus when Wall Street opens, after Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed, expressed concern over the viability of the data used to create the 90% efficacy level for the drug makerâ€™s Covid-19 vaccine candidate.
 
 4. Sterling retains strength, for now
 
 Sterling remains near three-month highs against the U.S. dollar, despite U.K. Finance Minister Rishi Sunakâ€™s horrific spending review a couple of days ago.
 
 Sunak laid bare the weak state of the U.K.â€™s finances, saying that Britain is set to borrow almost 400 billion pounds ($533 billion) this year, equivalent to 19% of GDP, the highest ever in peacetime. He added that the British economy is set to contract by 11.3% in 2020, the largest fall for more than 300 years.
 
 Yet, despite this, sterling remains relatively strong with traders continuing to expect late progress on Brexit talks between the U.K. and the European Union, with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier traveling to London late Friday as the two sides try to resolve differences over fishing and competition policy.
 
 â€œOnce again, the make-or-break moment for sterling (with asymmetrical downside risks in case of no deal) looks around the corner, but timing remains a big question mark,â€ said analysts at ING, in a research note.
 
 5. Oil mixed; OPEC+ meeting seen key
 
 Crude oil prices traded mixed Friday, but still close to their post-pandemic highs as attention turns to next weekâ€™s crucial meeting of OPEC+.
 
 By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), futures were down 0.8% at $45.34 a barrel, while futures were up 0.8% at $48.16.
 
 Reuters reported Friday that the leading oil producing countries, a group known as OPEC+, will hold informal online talks on Saturday prior to next weekâ€™s key meetings.
 
 The group has come under pressure to maintain the current level of oil production, given sluggish oil demand and fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. OPEC+ had previously agreed to increase output by 2 million barrels a day in January as part of a steady easing of record supply cuts as oil prices rose.
 
 However, the decision to extend current production levels is by no means certain as a number of countries within the cartel are seeking to maximise revenue by increasing production levels.",Â Reuters

 BENGALURU (Reuters) - Serum Institute of India, the world's largest vaccine producer, said on Thursday it has made 40 million doses of AstraZeneca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, and would soon begin making Novavax 's rival shot, as they both seek regulatory approval.
 
 Serum said it had enrolled 1,600 participants in India for late-stage trials of AstraZeneca's (L: ) candidate, and also plan s to seek regulatory approval to run late-stage trials for the Novavax (O: ) vaccine.
 
 The AstraZeneca vaccine, co-developed by Oxford University, is the most advanced in human testing in India, Serum said, adding that the company and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will pursue ""early availability"" of the shot in India.
 
 Representatives for both Serum and the ICMR declined to comment on whether the 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were meant for supply only in India.
 
 The ICMR, a federal government body, had funded the clinical trial site fees for the AstraZeneca vaccine, Serum said. The company and the ICMR are currently conducting mid-stage clinical trials of the shot at 15 centres across India.
 
 The news came as coronavirus infections in India, the world's second-worst hit country, reached 8.68 million on Thursday and the death toll increased to more than 128,000.
 
 India also has at least two home-grown COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development, while local drugmaker Dr Reddy's Labs (NS: ) is carrying out a trial in the country for Russia's vaccine candidate.
 
 Earlier this week, Pfizer (N: ) and its partner BioNTech (DE: ) said their vaccine candidate had proven more than 90% effective based on initial trial results.

 By Steve Stecklow
 
 LONDON (Reuters) - So why did I volunteer to be injected with an experimental vaccine for COVID-19? That's what some of my friends wanted to know when I told them what I was doing.
 
 ""Who knows about the long term,"" texted a former college roommate. ""Seems like a gamble.""
 
 It all began in July when the British government announced it was seeking lots of volunteers for large-scale clinical trials of new vaccines. Only a month before, a good friend of mine here had died of COVID-19 after spending weeks on a ventilator.
 
 Curious, I completed an online form, figuring I wasn't committing myself to anything.
 
 In late September, an email informed me that I was among more than 250,000 ""pioneers in the fight against COVID-19"" who had enlisted in the cause. On Oct. 1, I was invited to apply for a trial of a vaccine made by an American biotech company called Novavax Inc (O: ). It was seeking at the time up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom for a late-stage trial to determine the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.
 
 ""If you are aged 18-84 and in good health, you could be eligible to participate,"" the email stated. ""The study involves six visits over a period of around 13 months. Reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed.""
 
 Now, it was time to decide. I began researching the Novavax vaccine, which has received less attention than several others. On Monday, Pfizer Inc (N: ) announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appeared to be more than 90% effective. In September, late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) were halted after a report of a serious neurological illness in a volunteer, although the trials later were permitted to resume.
 
 To me, the Novavax vaccine seemed less risky. Although the Maryland-based company has never received approval for a vaccine, it's employing the same technology to create its COVID-19 candidate that it used with a promising flu shot. I've gotten inoculated against the flu every year for decades and never once had an adverse reaction.
 
 The published results of the first phase of testing the Novavax vaccine also showed no serious side effects among more than 100 participants who were injected with it. The worst case was someone who had a mild fever for a day.
 
 I decided to go for it. I figured if life is ever going to return to normal, the world is going to need vaccines and volunteers to see if they work. On a selfish level, I liked the idea of getting inoculated as soon as possible, given how monotonous â€“ and sometimes scary â€“ my daily routine had become. I've become so risk-averse that my wife has called me her ""jailer.""
 
 Another attraction: If I were to catch the virus, the researchers would carefully monitor me. In the UK, where there has been a surge in new COVID-19 cases to more than 20,000 a day, infected people essentially are on their own unless they require emergency care.
 
 Of course, there was a 50-50 chance I would be injected with a placebo â€“ a saline solution â€“ that wouldn't protect me against anything. In testing vaccines, placebos are used as a control to see whether the real thing is more effective at fending off the virus.
 
 And so, after an online and over-the-phone screening to determine if I had any medical conditions that disqualified me from the study, I was given an appointment for the first of two injections.
 
 I showed up one recent morning at the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London â€“ a small, drab building that is part of a sprawling medical complex. To my surprise, the receptionist asked me to take off my ""Churchill Pro"" bike mask â€“ which costs $33 and uses ""British Military Filtration Technology"" to block ""almost 100%"" of viruses â€“ and replace it with a cheap, disposable one. I later learned this was because my super-duper mask potentially could be contaminated.
 
 Several other volunteers were already in a large room getting set up. I met privately with a doctor who asked if I had any questions. I had a few: ""What if the Novavax vaccine proved so successful that the trial was stopped? Would I be told whether I received the placebo and, if so, be given the real vaccine?"" The doctor told me that if I had gotten the placebo, I would have to wait a year, since the researchers would want to keep monitoring every trial participant. Not what I wanted to hear.
 
 ""What if another vaccine is approved first and I was given the placebo? Would I be allowed to take that?"" The doctor suggested that was possible.
 
 After I signed a consent form to participate in the trial, she gave me a brief physical exam. Back in the large room, a nurse gave me a COVID-19 test, sticking a long swab up my throat and then through a nostril. Then he prepared to draw my blood. I warned him my veins were thin and often proved problematic. He proceeded to fail twice before calling over a colleague who had better luck.
 
 The injection itself was uneventful. But when the nurse checked my blood pressure afterward, it had spiked. He asked me to wait a few minutes and basically calm down. I thought about the meditation exercises I had always scoffed at but had recently tried to reduce pandemic-induced anxiety â€“ breathe in, breathe out. It worked.
 
 So far, I've experienced no side effects and am awaiting a second injection once three weeks have passed. Curious about my experience, I spoke to James Galloway, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College who is the doctor responsible for my trial.
 
 He told me that no decisions have been made on what to do with volunteers who received the placebo if Novavax is shown to be effective or another vaccine is approved first. He later added, ""If we get another vaccine that works, we'd want people to get that vaccine if they've had the placebo.""
 
 ""We don't want anyone to suffer from participating in the study,"" he said.
 
 A spokeswoman for Novavax later told me volunteers would discuss their options with the clinicians overseeing the trial sites.
 
 Galloway said there's a theoretical risk if someone who got the Novavax vaccine is injected with a different one. ""There's a chance you'd have a reaction.""
 
 He doesn't know how the UK Novavax trial is going so far because he doesn't have access to the data. But overall, he remains optimistic that effective vaccines against COVID-19 will arrive.
 
 As it happens, the 42-year-old doctor contracted COVID-19 himself last spring. He said he had a fever for 10 days and was briefly hospitalized after developing a heart rhythm problem. ""I wouldn't wish it on anyone,"" he said.

 Investing.com -- Senate Leader Mitch McConnell thwarts Donald Trumpâ€™s plan for higher stimulus payments, the U.K. approves the AstraZeneca/Oxford University vaccine, and reaches another all-time high. Hereâ€™s what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, December 30th.
 
 1. McConnell defies Trumpâ€™s stimulus call
 
 President Donald Trumpâ€™s efforts to increase the part of the recent $900 billion stimulus package that is paid directly to households ran into the sand, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to schedule a quick vote on the motion that passed the House of Representatives earlier in the week.
 
 McConnell has now combined that initiative into a new bill that would combine increased payments with other provisions that House Democrats are sure to reject, such as the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (which gives social media platforms protection from legal liability for the content posted by their users) and a commission to look into Trumpâ€™s claims of election fraud which have been thrown by over 50 courts across the U.S. so far).
 
 As such, the level of direct payments is likely to stay at $600, rather than the $2,000 demanded by Trump and approved by the House.
 
 2 AstraZeneca vaccine gets first approval
 
 The U.K.â€™s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency approved the use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca (LON: ) and the University of Oxford.
 
 Itâ€™s the first formal approval for a vaccine which appears to be slightly less effective against the disease than those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (NASDAQ: ), but which is set to play a much broader role in immunizing the worldâ€™s population, given that the company is selling it at cost while the pandemic continues, and can be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, easing the challenge of mass distribution.
 
 The move comes as U.K. hospitals are starting to run out of capacity for Covid-19 patients. Germany, meanwhile, registered over 1,000 deaths in a single day from Covid-19 for the first time.
 
 3. Stocks set to rebound
 
 U.S. stock markets are set to open higher, after a modest setback late on Tuesday in response to Senate Leader McConnellâ€™s effective blocking of higher stimulus payments.
 
 By 6:30 AM ET (1130 GMT), were up 111 points, or 0.4%, while were also up 0.4% and were up 0.3%.
 
 Corporate newsflow remains at a trickle, but there will be U.S. data in the shape of the at 9:45 AM ET and Novemberâ€™s figures at 10 AM.
 
 4. Digital currencies set fresh highs
 
 Bitcoin continued its triumphant march higher, topping $28,000 for the first time against a background of fading trust in the dollar, whose long-term debasement through the U.S.â€™s enduring current account and budget deficits is set to accelerate.
 
 By 6:30 AM ET, was trading at $27,921, up 4.7% on the day, having earlier traded as high as $28,587.
 
 The fundamentals for the digital asset remain the same: no country will accept taxes to be paid with it, and merchants overwhelmingly refuse to set prices in something with such a volatile price. However, its lack of practical applications is being overshadowed by an ever-broader willingness on the part of institutional money managers to speculate on it, reassured by the prospect of Bitcoin supply remaining essentially fixed.
 
 Bitcoin isnâ€™t the only digital asset currently enjoying itself. has rallied over five-fold this year, although it was essentially flat on Wednesday at $728.81.
 
 5. Last U.S. oil inventories of the year
 
 The price of crude oil, which has lots of practical applications, rebounded modestly overnight, supported by American Petroleum Industry data showing an unexpectedly large drop in U.S. crude .
 
 The U.S. governmentâ€™s data are due at 10:30 AM ET, as usual. Analysts warn against reading too much into the last weekly data of the year, which tend to be distorted by accounting and tax issues.

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca said on Monday it will transfer global rights for respiratory medicines Eklira and Duaklir to Covis Pharma Group for $270 million, as the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker looks to offload its older portfolio of medicines.
 
 The London-listed company also said that under the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, Covis will also cover certain ongoing development costs related to the medicines.
 
 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ), which has several new medicines in its pharmaceutical pipeline, including COVID-19 drugs and a vaccine, expects the agreement to help sharpen its focus on priority medicines in its respiratory and immunology portfolio.
 
 Covis had previously acquired the rights to other respiratory medicines Alvesco, Omnaris and Zetonna from AstraZeneca in 2018.

 Investing.com - The pound reached its highest level against the US dollar since April 2018 on Thursday, continuing its strong run over the last two weeks. hit 1.3746 in morning trade with a few factors at play.
 
 On Wednesday, Bank of England Governor Bailey again reiterated his stance on negative interest rates. â€œWe have not taken any decision, in fact weâ€™ve not actually discussed, whether or not to introduce negative rates,â€ Bailey said, while adding that he was uncertain how much it would help the economy.
 
 VACCINES
 
 Further supporting the pound has been the UKâ€™s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines which has happened at a quicker pace than most neighbouring countries. The UK has benefitted from rapid approval of the various vaccines and supply has been relatively stable. There were some fears that a factory producing supplies of the Oxford/AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) vaccines in Wales could flood due to Storm Christoph but local emergency services prevented any serious disruption. Wockhardt Ltd (NS: ), the company that produces the vaccine at the facility confirmed the site was operating as normal.
 
 German investment bank Berenberg are optimistic about the UK vaccination programme, saying that if the country were to maintain the average pace of daily vaccinations of the past week, the UK could reach a vaccination rate of 60% by June this year, a figure where the rate of infection would slow, and the UK would be close to herd immunity.
 
 Infection rates also appear to be slowing, albeit at a snailâ€™s pace. Imperial College London professor Paul Elliott told the BBC that the current R rate was around 1. ""We're seeing this levelling off, it's not going up, but we're not seeing the decline that we really need to see,â€ Elliott said. Meanwhile, the number of people testing positive for the virus over the last seven days is down over 20% from the week before.
 
 BREXIT
 
 Finally, the avoidance of a so-called â€œhard Brexitâ€ has also lifted the pound. After the agreement reached between the UK and the EU towards the tail end of last year, investors have some certainty about the trading relationship for the first time in years even if there have been teething problems since the introduction of the new trading arrangement. Todayâ€™s report from the showed a large number of manufacturers were worried about supply chain disruption said that border challenges and customs-related delays arising from Brexit appeared to be playing a role.",Â Reuters    AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio PFE 140 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    LONDON Reuters  It is possible to get an extra dose out of vials of AstraZeneca PLC LON COVID19 vaccine as well as the one made by Pfizer NYSE  the head of immunisation at Public Health England PHE said on Wednesday    In December the health service gave doctors advice that they could use extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine at their discretion if they could be extracted and on Wednesday Dr Mary Ramsay said it was happening with AstraZeneca's shot too    We have been able to get more vaccine out of each vial and that's happened for the Pfizer vaccine and it's also happening with the AstraZeneca vaccine So that means overall we've got more vaccines to go around she told lawmakers adding that PHE had bought the necessary needles from the start    Really very early on we discovered that we're able to get more out of the vials which is excellent news Â Reuters    GBPUSD 190 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio WCKH 093 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    By Samuel Indyk    Investingcom  The pound reached its highest level against the US dollar since April 2018 on Thursday continuing its strong run over the last two weeks hit 13746 in morning trade with a few factors at play    On Wednesday Bank of England Governor Bailey again reiterated his stance on negative interest rates âœWe have not taken any decision in fact weâve not actually discussed whether or not to introduce negative ratesâ Bailey said while adding that he was uncertain how much it would help the economy    VACCINES    Further supporting the pound has been the UKâs rollout of the COVID19 vaccines which has happened at a quicker pace than most neighbouring countries The UK has benefitted from rapid approval of the various vaccines and supply has been relatively stable There were some fears that a factory producing supplies of the OxfordAstraZeneca PLC LON  vaccines in Wales could flood due to Storm Christoph but local emergency services prevented any serious disruption Wockhardt Ltd NS  the company that produces the vaccine at the facility confirmed the site was operating as normal    German investment bank Berenberg are optimistic about the UK vaccination programme saying that if the country were to maintain the average pace of daily vaccinations of the past week the UK could reach a vaccination rate of 60 by June this year a figure where the rate of infection would slow and the UK would be close to herd immunity    Infection rates also appear to be slowing albeit at a snailâs pace Imperial College London professor Paul Elliott told the BBC that the current R rate was around 1 We're seeing this levelling off it's not going up but we're not seeing the decline that we really need to seeâ Elliott said Meanwhile the number of people testing positive for the virus over the last seven days is down over 20 from the week before    BREXIT    Finally the avoidance of a socalled âœhard Brexitâ has also lifted the pound After the agreement reached between the UK and the EU towards the tail end of last year investors have some certainty about the trading relationship for the first time in years even if there have been teething problems since the introduction of the new trading arrangement Todayâs report from the showed a large number of manufacturers were worried about supply chain disruption said that border challenges and customsrelated delays arising from Brexit appeared to be playing a role,0.3929435626102291,0.0994970338303672

 Investing.com â€“ The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended granting a conditional marketing authorisation for AstraZeneca PLC (LON: )â€™s vaccine to prevent Covid-19 in people from 18 years of age. The EMA added that their scientific experts considered the vaccine can be used in older adults.
 
 The agencyâ€™s human medicines committee (CHMP) assessed that the vaccine and said it meets EU standards and puts in place the safeguards, controls and obligations to underpin EU-wide vaccination campaigns.
 
 OLDER POPULATION
 
 There had been some concern that the EU would not recommend the vaccine be taken by those over the age of 65. â€œThere are not yet enough results in older participants (over 55 years old) to provide a figure for how well the vaccine will work in this group,â€ the EMA said in a statement. â€œHowever, protection is expected, given that an immune response is seen in this age group and based on experience with other vaccines; as there is reliable information on safety in this population, EMAâ€™s scientific experts considered that the vaccine can be used in older adults.â€
 
 EFFICACY
 
 The agency based their calculation of the efficacy of the vaccine on the results from two studies, the COV002 study (based in UK) and the COV003 study (based in Brazil). The other two studies involved in the clinical trial had fewer than six Covid-19 cases in each which was not enough to measure the preventative effect of the vaccine.
 
 â€œThese [studies] showed a 59.5% reduction in the number of symptomatic Covid-19 cases in people given the vaccine (64 of 5,258 got Covid-19 with symptoms) compared with people given control injections (154 of 5,210 got Covid-19 with symptoms),â€ the EMA said. â€œThis means that the vaccine demonstrated around a 60% efficacy in the clinical trials.â€
 
 GERMANY
 
 The previous day, issued a draft recommendation to should not be used in over-65s. The Robert Koch Institute â€“ Germanyâ€™s federal public health agency â€“ said there was insufficient data in those over 65 to ascertain how effective the vaccine would be.
 
 This followed a story in Handelsblatt earlier in the week that suggested the vaccine was unsafe in those over 65, saying it had only 8% efficacy. A statement by the German health ministry later clarified that the publication had mixed up the efficacy rate with the number of over 65s in the trial.
 
 PRODUCTION
 
 There are still question marks over production and supply of the vaccine to EU member countries. The EU are vocally unhappy with AstraZeneca, alleging they have reneged on contracts for supply of the vaccine. However, AstraZeneca came out fighting, saying that the supply problems were a fault of the EU and the time it took to agree a contract. For context, the UK agreed a contract a full three months before the European Union and AstraZeneca say that the teething problems related to production were ironed out in the early part of the process.
 
 The drug company had previously said it would have to cut Q1 supplies to the bloc by 60% but today reportedly offered the EU more than 8 million more doses of its vaccine this quarter. AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot previously said there were no legal obligations to deliver on a precise timescale because it had only committed to supply under a â€œbest-effortâ€ clause. The European Union today published the contract, in order to be transparent, which they allege contained â€œbinding ordersâ€.

 Investing.com â€“ GBP continues to strengthen with breaking back above 1.39 and EUR/GBP falling to its lowest level since April last year.
 
 The pound has been one of the better performing currencies of 2021 as the UK pushes ahead with its vaccination programme and after the Bank of England effectively ruled out negative interest rates in the near term at their February meeting.
 
 The pair currently tests its lows from April 2020 which was seen 0.8671 and some technical analysts have suggested a firm break below that level could push the pair down towards 0.8500 if downside momentum were to accelerate. Of note, there are large sized options expiring at 0.8700 in EUR/GBP (546mln) at todayâ€™s 10am NY cut.
 
 As mentioned, GBP/USD trades back above 1.3900 and looks set to test the high seen on Tuesday at 1.3952. A break above that level could see the psychological 1.4000 level come into play.
 
 Vaccines
 
 GBP has benefitted from the UKâ€™s vaccination effort with almost 16mln people now given at least one dose of one of the jabs. The EUâ€™s rollout has been less successful and yesterday there were reports that some AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) vaccines in the EU were going unused amid concerns from health workers in France and Germany about side effects. If the UK keeps vaccinating at the same rate, there is hope that at least every adult who wants a vaccine may be able to have one by the summer, prompting hopes that the economy can reopen sooner rather than later and a sense of normality will return.
 
 Bank of England policymaker Andy Haldane has recently spoken of the huge pent-up demand waiting to be released. ""The recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget,"" Haldane said. The Bank of England's chief economist said we could see double digit annual growth and inflation on target. If he's right then the GBP could still have further to run.",https://uk.investing.com//news/forex-news/pound-rally-continues-as-cable-breaks-back-above-13900-2305231,0.042,0.875,0.083,0.9433,"Â© Reuters

 Investing.com â€“ The trades relatively flat at the midpoint of the trading day despite services sector activity falling to its lowest level since May. The IHS Markit survey showed that businesses were struggling in the latest lockdown, particularly those in the hospitality and travel & leisure sector. However, businesses are optimistic with growth expectations at their highest level since 2014 on prospects of a strong reopening as the vaccine effort continues.
 
 Vodafone Group PLC (LON: ) shares rose to the top of the blue-chip index after a positive trading update where they had benefited from work from home policies in Germany. Separately, they announced that the spinoff of their towers division, Vantage Towers, was on track for early 2021. Reuters had earlier reported that the company is expected to list the division in Frankfurt in March this year.
 
 Vaccine Makers
 
 AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) was again in focus after early studies showed that a single dose of the vaccine was 76% effective for up to 12 weeks, justifying the UKâ€™s decision to vaccinate as many people as possible in as quick a time frame as feasible. The data - published by Oxford University - is not yet peer-reviewed but will provide the UK government with assurance that they have made the right decision. On the other hand, France has followed Germanyâ€™s lead and recommended that the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab not be given to those over 65, given a lack of data in the early trials. This comes despite the European Medicines Agency authorising the use of the jab for over 65s.
 
 Another UK-based pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON: ), announced a deal with Germanyâ€™s CureVac NV (NASDAQ: ) to work together to develop vaccines against the new variants of the virus. The deal, worth EUR 150mln, will also see GlaxoSmithKline assist in manufacturing CureVacâ€™s current vaccine candidate for the original strain.

 LONDON (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) that use mRNA technology provide the biggest boost to antibody levels when given 10-12 weeks after the second dose, a new British study has found.
 
 The ""COV-Boost"" study was cited by British officials when they announced that Pfizer and Moderna were preferred for use in the country's booster campaign, but the data has only been made publicly available now.
 
 The study found that six of the seven boosters examined enhanced immunity after initial vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, while all seven increased immunity when given after two doses of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s vaccine.
 
 ""A third dose will be effective for many of the vaccines we've tested and in many different combinations,"" Professor Saul Faust, an immunologist at the University of Southampton and the trial's lead, told reporters.
 
 The study, published late on Thursday, found that a full dose or half dose of Pfizer or a full dose of Moderna gave a strong boost to both antibody and T-cell levels, regardless of whether the person initially received Pfizer or AstraZeneca.
 
 ""All four of the vaccination regimes most widely deployed in the UK lead to essentially the same levels of immunity and are likely to be equally effective,"" said Professor Eleanor Riley, immunologist at the University of Edinburgh. She added that a policy change in booster gaps was also supported by the data.
 
 ""These data support the JCVI (vaccine committee) decision earlier this week to bring forward booster doses to 3 months after the second vaccination.""
 
 When AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and Curevac were given as boosters, they increased antibody levels for either initial vaccine, albeit to a smaller degree, the study found. However, while Valneva boosted antibodies in people initially vaccinated with AstraZeneca, it did not provide a boost for Pfizer.
 
 The COV-Boost study pre-dated the spread of the emergent Omicron variant of concern, and Faust said he had shared samples with the UK Health Security Agency to generate data on Omicron.
 
 The study did however find that booster shots also helped to generate a broad T-cell response against the Beta and Delta variants, which may play a key role in longer-term protection.
 
 A separate study by Imperial College London into how initial exposure to SARS-CoV-2 shapes immune responses, also published late on Thursday, similarly found a good T-cell response to both Alpha and Delta after infection followed by vaccination.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/uk-study-finds-mrna-covid19-vaccines-provide-biggest-booster-impact-2526562,0.0,0.899,0.101,0.9934,"Â© Reuters.

 Investing.com -- Crude oil prices weakened Tuesday, handing back some of the recent gains amid concerns over the speed of the global oil demand recovery and ahead of the latest inventories data.
 
 By 9:25 AM ET (1425 GMT), U.S. crude futures traded 1.7% lower at $64.23 a barrel, while the international benchmark contract fell 1.6%, to $67.78.
 
 U.S. Gasoline RBOB Futures were down 0.6% at $2.0913 a gallon.
 
 Weighing on prices Tuesday was the release of data showing U.S. declined 3% in February, a lot more than the 0.5% drop expected, after a winter snap sharply reduced economic activity. This followed an upwardly revised 7.6% surge in January, the strongest advance in seven months.
 
 This added to concern already in play over the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Europe, and the potential for extended mobility restrictions.
 
 German coronavirus infections are spreading exponentially, up 20% in the last week, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday, while Italy is set to implement a new lockdown over the Easter holiday weekend.
 
 Throw in a number of countries, including Germany, France and Italy, suspending the use of AstraZeneca PLC (LON: )â€™s Covid-19 vaccine over concerns about blood clots, and concerns are growing about a slow pace of vaccinations in the region, which may delay any economic recovery from the pandemic.
 
 â€œFor oil demand to fully recover, a successful and rapid inoculation of the global population needs to take place. Before the recent setback, there was positivity that the campaigns under way were on the right track,â€ said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy.

 Investing.com â€“ The FTSE 100 finished Tuesday higher ahead of key interest rate decisions from the Federal Reserve and Bank of England this week.
 
 Vaccine maker AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) was again in focus after a number of European countries suspended the rollout of the jab amid fears of an increased number of blood clots from those that had had the vaccine.
 
 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) was forced to hold a press conference where they said there was no indication that the vaccine had caused the blood clot incidents while reiterating that the benefits of taking the vaccine still outweigh the risks. Nevertheless, at the time of publication, none of the countries that have suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine have reversed their decision. The EMA did state that they are investigating the reports and they anticipate coming to a conclusion on Thursday.

 Royal Dutch Shell and BP propped up the blue-chip index as oil prices fell on recovery concerns. Weighing on prices was the US retail sales data which showed a decline of 3% in February, worse than the expected 0.5% drop. Separately, Covid-19 cases are picking up in various European countries and the suspension of the vaccine rollout could harm the recovery even further, potentially weighing on oil demand.

 Investing.com â€“ Shares in AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) were at the top of the on Tuesday morning as the company shrugged off concerns about its vaccine. At 10:25GMT shares were up 3.1% at 7,195. .
 
 On Monday, the four largest countries in the EU â€“ Germany, France, Italy, and Spain â€“ all suspended the rollout of the Oxford/ jab amid reports that several people who had received the jab had developed blood clots.
 
 What we know so far
 
 The big 4 EU countries are not the only ones to suspend the vaccine. Austria, the Netherlands, Denmark, and non-EU countries including Iceland, Norway, and Thailand have all halted the use of the vaccine as a precautionary measure.
 
 However, regulators are less concerned about the blood clotting events. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) yesterday provided an update on the so-called thromboembolic events saying that they were investigating the situation but not changing their view on the whether rollout should be stopped.
 
 â€œThe benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19, with its associated risk of hospitalisation and death, outweigh the risks of side effects,â€ the EMA said in a statement.
 
 The EMAâ€™s safety committee is scheduled to meet today to review the information and has called an extraordinary meeting on Thursday to conclude on the information gathered and whether any further action needs to be taken.
 
 The UKâ€™s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said they closely reviewing reports but the evidence available does not suggest the vaccine is the cause.
 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has also urged countries not to panic and not pause their vaccination programmes adding there was no evidence of a link between the vaccine and blood clots.
 
 The WHO's vaccine safety experts are meeting today to discuss the jab.
 
 Political Decision?
 
 The Director General of Italyâ€™s medicines authority AIFA said that the decision to suspend shots by a number of European countries was a â€œpolitical oneâ€.
 
 ""We got to the point of a suspension because several European countries, including Germany and France, preferred to interrupt vaccinations... to put them on hold in order to carry out checks. The choice is a political one,"" Nicola Magrini said in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
 
 Magrini expects that it will take a few days to gather the data and once doubts are cleared, the vaccination programme will carry on at a faster speed than before.

 Investing.com -- Rising Covid-19 cases in Europe, India and South America stoke fears about a delay to the global economic recovery, despite AstraZeneca publishing upbeat results from a major trial of its vaccine in North and South America. Turkey's currency and stock market tumble after President Erdogan fires his central bank chief for raising interest rates too sharply; Gamestop reports earnings; there's a big railroad merger in the works, and Saudi Aramco is borrowing heavily to defend its $75 billion dividend. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Monday, March 22nd.
 
 1. U.S. trial results vindicate AstraZeneca as European vaccine dispute deepens
 
 AstraZeneca (LON: ) cleared a major hurdle in getting its vaccine authorized in the U.S., as the U.K. and EU moved closer to blocking exports of vaccines to each other.
 
 The U.K.-Swedish company said its vaccine was 79% effective in stopping symptomatic Covid-19 and 100% effective in preventing death and hospitalization, in a trial that covered over 32,000 volunteers in the U.S. The test results also showed no issues with blood clotting disorders, concerns over which had led many EU countries to suspend distribution of the vaccine earlier this month.
 
 The news comes on a day when Europeâ€™s largest economy, Germany, is set to join France in tightening and extending lockdown restrictions through the middle of April in response to a surge in new infections in the last two weeks.
 
 Outside Europe, India reported its highest daily death count in over two months, while new infections hit an all-time record in Brazil and Chile. There were also signs of hiccups in the U.S.â€™s reopening, with fights among massive crowds of Spring Break tourists that led Miami Beach to declare a state of emergency.
 
 2. Third time lucky for CPR
 
 Canadian Pacific (NYSE: ) finally succeeded in persuading a U.S. railroad operator to merge with it and create the first railroad operator to link all three major markets in North America.
 
 CPR and Kansas City Southern (NYSE: ) said they had agreed to a deal valuing KCSâ€™s debt and equity at around $25 billion. The merger will still need antitrust clearance. KCS had rejected a $20 billion bid from Blackstone (NYSE: ) and Global Infrastructure Partners in September.
 
 Blackstone was on the acquisition trail elsewhere at the weekend, proposing to buy trouble Australian casino operator Crown Resorts (ASX: ) for $6.2 billion in a deal that would offer shareholders in Crown an exit from a company beset by money-laundering allegations.
 
 Semiconductor stocks will also be in focus after a fire at a factory owned by Japan's Renesas Electronics (T: ), which threatens to aggravate the current shortage of chips worldwide.
 
 3. Stocks set to open mostly lower; GameStop earnings eyed
 
 The bad news on the Covid-19 front has given an extra leg to the rebound in tech stocks and a setback to cyclicals, as markets around the world reprice their reopening bets. Yields on U.S. Treasuries meanwhile fell back to 1.68% by 6:10 AM ET (1010 GMT)
 
 were consequently underperforming in premarket trade, falling 85 points, or 0.3%, while were down 0.1%. were by contrast 0.5% higher.
 
 Other stocks likely to be in focus later include GameStop (NYSE: ), which is due to report for the three months through January â€“ the first update since the epic short-squeeze earlier in the year.
 
 Analysts expect a profit of $88 million, or $1.35 a share, on $2.2 billion in revenue. Also in focus will be Tesla (NASDAQ: ), whose biggest fund manager cheerleader Cathie Wood put out a new target price of $3,000 by 2025 at the weekend. data for February are also due, while the Federal Reserve's Randy Quarles, Mary Daly and Michelle Bowman all speak later.
 
 4. Turkey in turmoil
 
 Turkish financial markets went into meltdown mode after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired his central bank chief, Naci Agbul at the weekend, only two days after he raised interest rates by more than expected.
 
 Erdoganâ€™s intervention revived fears of a return to the previous economic policy that tolerated a sharp currency devaluation and raging inflation. Erdogan had appointed Naci Agbal last year in what had seemed a decisive return to more orthodox economic policies.
 
 The dollar rose by more than 10% against the in early trading but retraced to be up â€˜onlyâ€™ 9.8% by 6:10 AM ET after government officials downplayed suggestions that the country will impose capital controls to support the currency.
 
 The benchmark stock index also fell 9.2% while the yield on Turkeyâ€™s government debt soared to over 16%, its highest since 2019.
 
 5. Aramco defends dividend, at a price
 
 Saudi Aramco (SE: ), the worldâ€™s biggest oil company, said it would keep its dividend payment at $75 billion for 2020, despite a sharp drop in profits due to the pandemic.
 
 The decision says less about the outlook for the global oil industry than it does for the Saudi budget, which relies on Aramcoâ€™s dividend for most of its resources. Free cash flow fell to $49 billion, meaning that the company will have to borrow to cover the shortfall.

 Investing.com -- The rotation from growth to value took a pause on Monday as interest rates let out some steam and put the attention back on the big tech companies.
 
 As evidence the U.S. economy continues to reopen, the Transportation Security Administration screened 1.5 million travelers on Sunday, the most since March last year. Partiers are flocking to warmer weather climates, such as South Florida, where local officials had to impose a curfew to control crowds.
 
 But evidence of a new wave of infections both in the U.S. and overseas could derail progress. German authorities agreed to extend another national lockdown through mid-April. France, Poland, and Italy also have lockdowns. This is putting a damper on oil prices as investors worry about demand for fuel.
 
 Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade tensions appear to be on the rise again after the U.S. imposed sanctions against two Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses.
 
 Itâ€™s a light day for data and earnings. Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
 
 1. GameStop earnings compare to the marketâ€™s valuation
 
 The much-followed meme stock is scheduled to report first quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday. Itâ€™ll be its first report since the Reddit stock trading crowd anointed the video game retailer the granddaddy of short squeezes. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect EPS of $1.35 on revenue of $2.2 billion.
 
 GameStop Corp (NYSE: ) shares trade nearly 10 times more than they did at the start of the year (based on Fridayâ€™s close), with a market value of more than $13 billion. It has a new strategy to focus on ecommerce thanks to investor and board member Ryan Cohen, the founder of Chewy Inc (NYSE: ). But that work has just begun.
 
 2. More home sales data
 
 data will be released Tuesday at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) and analysts expect the February numbers to show a 6.5% decline from the prior month.
 
 Investors will be looking at the numbers to compare them to Mondayâ€™s , which showed a drop in the number of homebuyers who were listing their homes at this time. With limited supply, prices jumped 15.8% in February and the median price of a home sold was $313,000, the highest February price ever.
 
 3. Pharma stocks get a look
 
 AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) is getting its chance to shine after a rough few weeks facing questions about its two-dose Covid vaccine. On Monday, the company said its late stage trial proved 79% effective overall and 100% effective preventing serious illness and hospitalization. It plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.
 
 That would make it the fourth vaccine in the U.S., alongside Pfizer (NYSE: ), Moderna (NASDAQ: ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) as millions more Americans become eligible every day. Shares of AstraZeneca bounced 4% on Monday.",Â Reuters    TSLA 364 Add toRemove from a Portfolio 2222 029 Add toRemove from a Portfolio CWNHB 000 Add toRemove from a Portfolio 6723 228 Add toRemove

 Investing.com -- Testimony from both Fed chief Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to Congress is set to be the main focus of the markets Tuesday. Ahead of this, rising Covid-19 cases in Europe, resulting in Germany extending its mobility restrictions, are putting pressure on oil prices and equities. Turkish markets remain volatile after President Erdoganâ€™s axing of the central bank governor for being too hawkish, while doubts about AstraZenecaâ€™s vaccine reemerge. U.S. housing data are due for release, while U.K. employment data surprised on the upside. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Tuesday, March 23rd.
 
 1. Powell and Yellen to face House questions
 
 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen are set to start their two-day testimony before Congress later Tuesday, in front of the House Financial Services Committee. They are set to discuss the health of the U.S. economy and the importance of fiscal and monetary stimulus in the recovery from the pandemic.
 
 Yields on U.S. Treasuries have climbed to their highest levels in more than a year as financial markets have bet on the U.S. economy making a quicker recovery from the damage caused by the pandemic than the central bank currently predicts. And the pair are likely to get plenty of questions from a deeply politically divided Congress about whether these yields will continue to rise amid fears the economy will overheat.
 
 However, judging by released excerpts from his prepared testimony, Powell will reiterate the central bank's plan to support the recovery ""for as long as it takes"" as the economy remains below pre-pandemic levels. In particular, the labor market remains a concern for the Federal Reserve, with the unemployment rate, and the labor participation rate still below pre-pandemic levels.
 
 Yellen has said repeatedly over the past two months that the U.S. can afford to borrow more with interest rates historically low, and that while the debt level is large the cost to service those obligations is the same as it was in 2007.
 
 2. AstraZeneca's (NASDAQ: ) Covid-19 vaccine not yet fully cleared
 
 AstraZenecaâ€™s executives must have felt they had finally caught a break on Monday, after data from a large U.S. trial showed its Covid-19 vaccine proved 79% effective overall and 100% effective preventing serious illness and hospitalization.
 
 However, this has proved a false dawn, after a U.S. health agency questioned Tuesday whether the U.K.-Swedish company provided a complete view of efficacy data on its vaccine from the trial, casting doubt on its plan to seek U.S. emergency use authorization for the vaccine in the coming weeks.
 
 The Data Safety Monitoring Board ""expressed concern that AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data,"" the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in a statement.
 
 AstraZenecaâ€™s vaccine has been dogged by doubts over its efficacy, dosing regimen and possible side effects. Many European countries, including Germany and France, halted use of the vaccine earlier this month after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder.
 
 3. US stocks set to open lower; Europe down on Covid woes
 
 U.S. stock markets look set to open marginally lower Tuesday, amid cautious trading as investors await comments from Fed chief Powell and Treasury Secretary Yellen as they testify in front of Congress.
 
 At 06:05 AM ET (1005 GMT), were down 150 points, or 0.5%, while were down 0.4% and were down 0.2%.
 
 Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the marketâ€™s nadir when the pandemic caused stocks to plummet. Since that intraday low, both the and have advanced 80%, while the has gained over 90%.
 
 These expected losses on Wall Street follow weakness in Europe, with European equities retreating from a one-year peak as a new wave of coronavirus cases and a lockdown extension in Germany raised fears of a slow economic recovery.
 
 Additionally, Turkish stocks continued to fall, with the main index down 7%, after President Tayyip Erdogan abruptly fired the hawkish central bank governor at the weekend and installed a critic of the country's tight monetary stance. The countryâ€™s currency, the lira, has also been volatile, but has made back some of Mondayâ€™s sharp losses.
 
 4. U.S. housing data in focus; U.K. jobless rate falls
 
 With the minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting stating that the central bank will be studying actual economic data for monetary policy cues, focus will turn Tuesday to the release of the latest numbers from the housing market.
 
 This sector had been one of the beneficiaries of the pandemic as large numbers sought the sanctuary of the suburbs, moving away from the high-density cities. However, things have started to cool - on Monday showed a drop in the number of homebuyers who were listing their homes at this time.
 
 data will be released at 10:00 AM ET (1400 GMT) and analysts expect the February numbers to show a 6.5% decline from the prior month.
 
 Earlier Tuesday, Britain's unexpectedly fell to 5.0% in the three months to January, when the country entered a new lockdown, below forecasts of a rise to 5.2%.
 
 5. Oil hit by European coronavirus restrictions
 
 Crude prices weakened Tuesday amid growing concerns that a flaring up of Covid-19 cases in Europe will slow a recovery in demand, particularly ahead of the summer tourism season.
 
 At 6:10 AM ET (1010 GMT), futures were 3.5% lower at $59.42 a barrel, while futures were down 3.5% at $62.37 a barrel.
 
 Germany, Europe's biggest oil consumer, on Monday extended its lockdown until April 18 and asked citizens to stay home during the Easter holiday period to try and combat a third wave of infections hitting the continent.
 
 In a further blow for the tourism industry, fines of 5,000 pounds ($6,900) will be introduced for people from England who try to travel abroad before the end of June in a tightening of the country's border controls.
 
 On the supply side, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies (OPEC+) will convene on April 1 to determine production policy for May.
 
 â€œThe wobble in the market will give OPEC+ something to think about ahead of their meeting,â€ said analysts at ING, in a research note. â€œClearly, prior to the recent downward pressure, expectations were that OPEC+ would start to ease cuts. However, the group may be more hesitant to do so now, particularly if sentiment does not shift ahead of the meeting. â€œ

 (Bloomberg) -- The European Union announced it will give itself stronger powers to stop Covid vaccine exports to the rest of the world, setting the stage for an escalation of tensions with allies and manufacturers as it faces a third wave of infections.
 
 The EU, in strengthening its existing export rules, will demand that countries that received doses from the EU also allow shots to be sent back. It will also consider a nationâ€™s vaccination rate and pandemic situation when deciding whether to green light shipments. The mechanism wonâ€™t be automatic, but will be used on a case-by-case basis.
 
 The proposal comes as the bloc struggles to turn around its sluggish inoculation campaign and as governments from Berlin to Paris battle a rise in infections more than a year since they started. The situation has also been fueled by a spat with the U.K., itâ€™s former member, over vaccine supplies to Britain.
 
 â€œWe have to ensure timely and sufficient vaccine deliveries to EU citizens,â€ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. â€œThe EU is the only major Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development producer that continues to export vaccines at large scale to dozens of countries, but open roads should run in both directions.â€
 
 The new export rules coincide with the coronavirus situation in Europe getting bleaker as governments face pressure over why their citizens arenâ€™t being vaccinated as quickly as those elsewhere and the EU finds itself in disputes with manufacturers and other countries.
 
 When leaders hold a summit on Thursday, at which theyâ€™ll discuss the blocâ€™s latest powers, they will say the â€œsituation remains seriousâ€ and that â€œrestrictions, including non-essential travel, must therefore be upheld,â€ according to an EU document seen by Bloomberg.
 
 While the legislation isnâ€™t aimed at any specific countries, itâ€™s clear the U.K. could be one of the biggest targets, adding even more drama to an increasingly fraught relationship three months to the day since the two sides signed a trade deal. As well as disagreements over the export of Covid vaccines, the U.K. has refused to grant full rights to the blocâ€™s ambassador in London while the EU is still smarting from the U.K.â€™s threat -- later withdrawn -- to break international law last year and rewrite the Brexit agreement.
 
 The European Commissionâ€™s draft legislation published on Wednesday said governments should take into account issues including whether countries are exporting vaccines back to the EU, as well as their epidemiological and vaccine situation. The measures will stay in place until at least the end of June.
 
 According to the document, vaccine manufacturers have exported â€œlarge quantitiesâ€ to â€œcertain countries without production capacity, but which have a higher vaccination rateâ€ than the EU, or where the current rate of Covid infections isnâ€™t as high. Exports to these countries may â€œthreaten the security of supplyâ€ the legislation says.
 
 It adds that manufacturers have exported to countries that â€œhave a large production capacity of their ownâ€ yet â€œthose countries restrict their own exportsâ€ to the EU.
 
 The plan is aimed at companies such as Astrazeneca Plc (LON: ) that arenâ€™t delivering on their commitments and also factors in any possible future difficulties with companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) that are meeting their obligations, according to an official familiar with the proposal, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.
 
 Slow Rollout
 
 In an effort to get around claims by some governments -- notably the U.K. -- that they donâ€™t have formal export restrictions, the legislation makes clear that these can come about â€œeither by law or through contractual or other arrangements concluded with vaccine manufacturers.â€
 
 While a ban on exports to those countries wonâ€™t be automatic, â€œmember states should refuse export authorizations accordingly,â€ the draft said.
 
 The new rules could have consequences for the U.K. which, having received 11 million of the 45 million doses shipped out of the EU, is by far the biggest recipient of the blocâ€™s vaccines. It has also vaccinated at a faster rate and has falling infections.
 
 The bloc has administered 13 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the U.K. has managed, according to Bloombergâ€™s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. Israel has inoculated more than half of its population.
 
 Neighboring countries will be included in the new directive due to the increased risk of third parties using their special trade privileges to help circumvent the tighter export criteria, according to the document. The rules will include European Free Trade Association countries as well as those in the European Economic Area.
 
 Vaccine â€˜Greedâ€™
 
 U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters in London that all countries are â€œfighting the same pandemicâ€ and his government will â€œcontinue to work with our European partners.â€ Later, however, he risked inflaming tensions, telling a group of Conservative MPs in a private meeting via Zoom that the U.K.â€™s vaccine success was because of â€œgreed.â€
 
 The government sought to limit the damage, with cabinet minister Priti Patel taking the rare step of using television interviews to try to explain the premierâ€™s remarks. British officials do not usually comment in public on private discussions, such as the meeting Johnson had with his party.
 
 The EU and U.K. are currently negotiating how to divide up stock from an Astra plant in the Netherlands due to come on stream in the next few weeks. A European diplomat said there was scope for an agreement on some form of pro-rata distribution based on population size.
 
 Meanwhile, Canadaâ€™s government described the EUâ€™s proposals as â€œconcerning.â€ And in Australia, Health Minister Greg Hunt on Wednesday said his nation had received less than a fifth of the 3.8 million doses it contracted from AstraZenecaâ€™s European operations. Earlier this month, Italy blocked vaccine shipments to Australia using the EU mechanism.

 The plan is aimed at companies such as Astrazeneca Plc (LON: ) that arenâ€™t delivering on their commitments and also factors in any possible future difficulties with companies like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) that are meeting their obligations, according to an official familiar with the proposal, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.
 
 Slow Rollout
 
 In an effort to get around claims by some governments -- notably the U.K. -- that they donâ€™t have formal export restrictions, the legislation makes clear that these can come about â€œeither by law or through contractual or other arrangements concluded with vaccine manufacturers.â€
 
 While a ban on exports to those countries wonâ€™t be automatic, â€œmember states should refuse export authorizations accordingly,â€ the draft said.
 
 The new rules could have consequences for the U.K. which, having received 11 million of the 45 million doses shipped out of the EU, is by far the biggest recipient of the blocâ€™s vaccines. It has also vaccinated at a faster rate and has falling infections.
 
 The bloc has administered 13 doses per 100 people, less than a third of what the U.K. has managed, according to Bloombergâ€™s Coronavirus Vaccine Tracker. Israel has inoculated more than half of its population.
 
 Neighboring countries will be included in the new directive due to the increased risk of third parties using their special trade privileges to help circumvent the tighter export criteria, according to the document. The rules will include European Free Trade Association countries as well as those in the European Economic Area.
 
 Vaccine â€˜Greedâ€™
 
 U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters in London that all countries are â€œfighting the same pandemicâ€ and his government will â€œcontinue to work with our European partners.â€ Later, however, he risked inflaming tensions, telling a group of Conservative MPs in a private meeting via Zoom that the U.K.â€™s vaccine success was because of â€œgreed.â€
 
 The government sought to limit the damage, with cabinet minister Priti Patel taking the rare step of using television interviews to try to explain the premierâ€™s remarks. British officials do not usually comment in public on private discussions, such as the meeting Johnson had with his party.
 
 The EU and U.K. are currently negotiating how to divide up stock from an Astra plant in the Netherlands due to come on stream in the next few weeks. A European diplomat said there was scope for an agreement on some form of pro-rata distribution based on population size.
 
 Meanwhile, Canadaâ€™s government described the EUâ€™s proposals as â€œconcerning.â€ And in Australia, Health Minister Greg Hunt on Wednesday said his nation had received less than a fifth of the 3.8 million doses it contracted from AstraZenecaâ€™s European operations. Earlier this month, Italy blocked vaccine shipments to Australia using the EU mechanism.

 Investing.com -- More and more ships are backed up waiting to get into the Suez Canal, which may remain blocked until Sunday. The EU and U.K. dial down their vaccine war, ahead of a summit President Joe Biden will Zoom in to call for a united front against China, where a government media-led backlash against Nike (NYSE: ) and H&M (ST: ) is in progress after the companies said they would cut ties with cotton suppliers in Xinjiang over claims of forced labour. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) revises down its assessment of the efficacy of its Covid-19 drug - not by much, but enough to create some more head-scratching. And jobless claims data are expected to show the downward trend in unemployment reasserting itself. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, March 25th.
 
 1. Suez still blocked
 
 The Suez Canal, one of the most important arteries for global trade, remained blocked for a third day after a massive container ship jammed against its walls in heavy winds on Tuesday.
 
 Bloomberg reported that an elite salvage squad is due to arrive on site later Thursday to add its efforts to those of tugboats and diggers which have so far failed to extract the ship, which is longer than Parisâ€™s Eiffel Tower is tall. Dutch state TV quoted the head of that salvage company as saying that it might ""take weeks"" to unblock the canal.
 
 The blockage has left over 100 ships stranded while waiting for entrance to the Canal, a disruption that promises to be reflected in commodity prices and trade flows for at least a month. The Canal acts not only as a major conduit of from the Persian Gulf to Europe and the U.S. east coast, but also for Russian oil being shipped to Asia.
 
 Crude futures were down 1.7% at $60.17 a barrel, while was down 1.3% at $63.55 a barrel.
 
 2. Europe, U.K. dial down vaccine war; AstraZeneca revises drug data
 
 The U.K. and EU signalled a truce in their fight over vaccines, pledging to work together in a joint statement released ahead of an EU summit later in the day. The summit will also be attended, remotely, by U.S. President Joe Biden.
 
 Overnight, AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) updated its U.S. trial results to show a slightly lower efficacy rate for its Covid-19 vaccine. It now says the drug is 76% effective in stopping the virus, and repeated that it is 100% successful in preventing death and hospitalization.
 
 The discrepancy with the initial results nonetheless sheds an unwelcome light on AZâ€™s internal processes, adding to previous confusion over its initial test results in Europe. The AZ virus is a vital part of the global vaccination campaign, being substantially cheaper than those offered by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: ). Thatâ€™s important because the two worst outbreaks in the world at the present are raging in India and Brazil.
 
 3 Stocks set to open higher; jobless claims, Fed speakers eyed
 
 U.S. stocks are set to open modestly higher after their declines on Wednesday, with attention likely to be focused on the weekly report at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT).
 
 By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), were up 75 points, or 0.2%, while were up 0.3% and were up 0.5%.
 
 Initial claims are expected to have fallen to 730,000 from 770,000 the previous week, but arguably the more important number will be, as always, the total number of people on unemployment-related benefits. The final reading of fourth-quarter GDP is also due at the same time.
 
 There will be speeches from Federal Reserve members, , , , and in the course of the day.
 
 4. Emerging central banks ponder rising inflation; 's slide continues
 
 Itâ€™s another big day for emerging market central banks, with and both due to announce their latest monetary policy decisions. Inflationary pressures forced Turkey, Russia and Brazil into raising interest rates last week, and while analysts donâ€™t expect a hike at either meeting, the Mexican central bank in particular is expected to move to more hawkish guidance.
 
 Overnight, Switzerland left its monetary policy unchanged but toned down its talk about possibly intervening to cap the francâ€™s rise.
 
 In the digital currency space, Bitcoin continued to slide against a backdrop of negative commentary about Teslaâ€™s embrace of it. Bank of America (NYSE: ) analysts issued a note highlighting the currencyâ€™s carbon footprint, which is at odds with Teslaâ€™s stated goal of reducing carbon emissions. At a conference held by the Bank for International Settlements, former ECB board member Benoit Coeure repeated that Bitcoin has â€œfailedâ€ to establish itself as a genuine currency.
 
 5. Nike, H&M feel Chinese backlash after Xinjiang cotton boycott
 
 Stocks in focus later may include Nike, which is facing a backlash in China after cutting ties with cotton suppliers in the province of Xinjiang. Swedish fashion chain H&M is having the same problem.
 
 The companies made their moves after the U.S., EU and U.K. all imposed sanctions on Chinese officials in relation to allegations of human rights violations in Xinjiang, where the U.S. says China is conducting a genocide of its Muslim Uighur minority. China has angrily responded to what it sees as interference in its domestic affairs.

 At 4:50 AM ET (0850 GMT), the in Germany traded 0.1% lower, the in France fell 0.1%, while the U.K.'s index climbed 0.2%.
 
 The main focus for European markets is a virtual meeting between EU leaders to discuss the third wave of Covid-19 cases hitting the region as well as the associated slow vaccine rollout. The leaders are likely to discuss possible curbs on vaccine exports, a source of tension with the neighboring U.K., whose immunization program is more advanced.
 
 Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands have all recently tightened restrictions to combat the increasing number of infections, which are threatening to swamp the regionâ€™s hospitals.
 
 There was some good news for the region, as the GfK index came in at -6.2 in April, a small improvement from the -12.9 seen in March, but still indicative of a pessimistic consumer in the regionâ€™s largest domestic market as lockdowns weigh.
 
 Sentiment in the French manufacturing sector stabilized, with the Insee monthly survey showing sentiment in the sector remained at 98 in March, unchanged from Februaryâ€™s figure.
 
 In corporate news, AstraZeneca (LON: ) stock rose 0.5% after the drugmaker announced late Wednesday that its Covid vaccine was 76% effective at preventing symptomatic illness, only a slight drop from the 79% level it initially reported after questions were raised by the data used in its U.S. trial.
 
 Cineworld (LON: ) stock fell 8.8% after the cinema chain reported a $3 billion loss for 2020 and said it will ask shareholders to approve a raise in its debt ceiling.
 
 Hennes & Mauritz (ST: ) stock dropped 1.2% after the Chinese state media singled out the Swedish retailer on Wednesday for a statement last year in which the company said it was deeply concerned by reports of accusations of forced labour in Xinjiang.
 
 Oil prices fell Thursday, reversing Wednesdayâ€™s gains which came after a container ship got stuck in the Suez Canal, blocking one of the most important supply routes in the world. This passage remains plugged, but demand concerns have returned to the fore.

 Investing.com â€“ The FTSE 100 finished Friday higher to close the week with a gain of 0.5%.

 Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, with negative news on the Covid-19 front weighing ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report which could guide near term market sentiment.
 
 At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, traded largely flat, and dropped 50 points, or 0.4%. All three contracts slid lower after the New York Times reported that U.S. authorities are set to call for a pause on distributing Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: ) vaccine, amid worries about blood clotting issues. A similar problem has plagued AstraZeneca's (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) drug.
 
 This cautious trading comes ahead of the release of the March reading for the , due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to rise by 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.
 
 Stock markets have climbed to record levels of late, helped by expectations of a strong U.S. economic recovery. But concerns are increasing that the combination of unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus and pent up demand will lead to rampant inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policies more quickly than earlier anticipated.
 
 Fed officials have been at pains to point out that they see any bump up in inflation as temporary and remain committed to supporting the economic recovery until the jobs picture looks better, but a hefty CPI jump would raise the pressure, especially after Fridayâ€™s sharp rise in producer prices.
 
 â€œWith commodity prices and import prices continuing to surge and ISM manufacturing and services prices paid both at their highest level since 2008 there are increasing pipeline price pressures,â€ said analysts at ING, in a note.
 
 The bond market also traded in a subdued fashion Tuesday after a successful 10-year Treasury auction, with the benchmark yield edging slightly higher to trade near 1.69%, still well below the one-year high of around 1.78% seen at the end of March.
 
 Corporate news is set to pick up later in the week, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
 
 Ahead of this, Grab is likely to be in focus after the Asian ride-hailing and food delivery firm announced its intention to merge with Altimeter leading to a U.S. public listing, valuing the company at nearly $40 billion, the largest ever SPAC deal.
 
 Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by robust Chinese trade data, indicating continued economic recovery in the worldâ€™s largest crude importer, and tensions in the Middle East after the Yemen-based Houthi movement said it fired missiles on Saudi oil sites.
 
 Attention Tuesday will also be on oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is set to release its monthly report on the oil market.

 Investing.com - U.S. stocks are seen opening marginally lower Tuesday, with negative news on the Covid-19 front weighing ahead of a highly anticipated inflation report which could guide near term market sentiment.
 
 At 7:05 AM ET (1205 GMT), the contract was down 55 points, or 0.2%, traded largely flat, and dropped 50 points, or 0.4%. All three contracts slid lower after the New York Times reported that U.S. authorities are set to call for a pause on distributing Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE: ) vaccine, amid worries about blood clotting issues. A similar problem has plagued AstraZeneca's (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) drug.
 
 This cautious trading comes ahead of the release of the March reading for the , due at 8:30 AM ET (1330 GMT), which is expected to rise by 0.5% month-over-month and 2.5% year-over-year.
 
 Stock markets have climbed to record levels of late, helped by expectations of a strong U.S. economic recovery. But concerns are increasing that the combination of unprecedented levels of fiscal stimulus and pent up demand will lead to rampant inflation, forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policies more quickly than earlier anticipated.
 
 Fed officials have been at pains to point out that they see any bump up in inflation as temporary and remain committed to supporting the economic recovery until the jobs picture looks better, but a hefty CPI jump would raise the pressure, especially after Fridayâ€™s sharp rise in producer prices.
 
 â€œWith commodity prices and import prices continuing to surge and ISM manufacturing and services prices paid both at their highest level since 2008 there are increasing pipeline price pressures,â€ said analysts at ING, in a note.
 
 The bond market also traded in a subdued fashion Tuesday after a successful 10-year Treasury auction, with the benchmark yield edging slightly higher to trade near 1.69%, still well below the one-year high of around 1.78% seen at the end of March.
 
 Corporate news is set to pick up later in the week, with banking giants JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) set to report quarterly results on Wednesday.
 
 Ahead of this, Grab is likely to be in focus after the Asian ride-hailing and food delivery firm announced its intention to merge with Altimeter leading to a U.S. public listing, valuing the company at nearly $40 billion, the largest ever SPAC deal.
 
 Oil prices edged higher Tuesday, helped by robust Chinese trade data, indicating continued economic recovery in the worldâ€™s largest crude importer, and tensions in the Middle East after the Yemen-based Houthi movement said it fired missiles on Saudi oil sites.
 
 Attention Tuesday will also be on oil supply data from the American Petroleum Institute, while the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is set to release its monthly report on the oil market.
 
 U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $59.95 a barrel, while the contract rose 0.5% to $63.61.

 COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark on Wednesday became the first country to stop using AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s COVID-19 vaccine altogether, following news of its possible link to very rare blood clot cases, health authorities said.
 
 The decision will push back the scheduled conclusion of Denmark's vaccination scheme to early August from July 25, they said.
 
 Results of investigations into the blood clots ""showed real and serious side effects,"" health agency head Soren Brostrom said in a statement.
 
 ""Based on an overall consideration, we have therefore chosen to continue the vaccination programme for all target groups without this vaccine.""
 
 The European Union's drug watchdog said last week it had found a possible link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a brain blood clot, but said the risk of dying from COVID-19 was ""much greater"" than the risk of mortality from rare side effects.
 
 As of April 4, the European Medicines Agency had received reports of 169 cases of CVST after 34 million Astrazeneca (LON: ) doses had been administered in the European Economic Area.
 
 The EU regulator, however, left it to individual states to make their own risk assessments and decide how to administer the vaccine.
 
 Many countries in Europe and elsewhere have resumed administering the shot, with some restricting its use to certain age groups, mostly those aged above 50 or above 60.
 
 Denmark was the first country to initially suspend all usage of the vaccine in March over safety concerns, and has also put Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: )'s vaccine on pause pending further investigations into a possible similar blood clot link.
 
 Almost one million of the country's 5.8 million population have received their first shots, 77% getting Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, 7.8% Moderna (NASDAQ: )'s and 15.3% AstraZeneca's.
 
 Denmark is in the process of easing restrictions after its daily COVID-19 infection rate slowed to 500-600 from several thousand in December.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/in-world-first-denmark-ditches-astrazenecas-covid19-shot-2346453,0.05,0.916,0.033,-0.5023,"Â© Reuters.

 Investing.com -- Coinbase is set to go public via a direct listing at a reference price that values it north of $65 billion. Bitcoin and Dogecoin are basking in its reflected glory. JPMorgan (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: ) are expected to report banner earnings as the season for first-quarter updates kicks off in earnest. French luxury groups have already shown the way. Stocks are consolidating while they wait for the numbers, but oil is at its highest in over a week after the IEA joined OPEC in raising its demand forecasts for this year. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Wednesday, April 14th.
 
 1. Coinbase goes public as Bitcoin, DogeCoin hit new heights
 
 Coinbase, the worldâ€™s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is set to go public via a direct listing later, a landmark development that arguably pushes cryptocurrencies further toward the financial mainstream.
 
 The reference price has been set at $250 a share, which on its fully diluted share count of over 263 million would value the company at $65 billion â€“ in line with Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ) and more than London Stock Exchange Group (LON: ). The simpler share count listed in its prospectus gives a valuation of just under $50 billion.
 
 The company said earlier this month that it registered around $1.8 billion in revenue in the first quarter of this year, up over 800% from a year earlier, thanks to the explosive rise in prices for Bitcoin, Ether and other digital currencies.
 
 itself traded above $64,000 for the first time overnight, while DogeCoin, the digital currency that started as a joke and has been touted aggressively by Elon Musk in recent months, rose 75% (sic) with no obvious price trigger.
 
 2. Banks, luxury groups kick off earnings season
 
 The first-quarter earnings season starts in earnest, with JPMorgan, Wells Fargo (NYSE: ) and Goldman Sachs all set to report before the open. All three are expected to report sharp increases in earnings, thanks to the low comparables from the previous year.
 
 JPMorgan and Goldman are expected to have capitalized also on favourable capital market trends, not least through the massive increase in SPAC listings, which will in turn have helped their M&A advisory businesses.
 
 Overnight, French luxury groups LVMH (PA: ) and Christian Dior also impressed, reporting sharp year-on-year sales increases, as their wealthy clienteles diverted spending from travel and leisure to purses and fashion. Both stocks hit record highs in European trading, as did Gucci owner Kering (PA: ).
 
 3. Stocks drift ahead of earnings, Coinbase; Powell speaks at 12 PM ET.
 
 U.S. stock markets are drifting ahead of the release of key bank earnings later, with JPMorgan and Wells Fargo in particular eyed as proxies for the health of the broader U.S. economy.
 
 By 6:30 AM ET (1030 GMT), were down 10 points, or less than 0.1%, while were up by a similar amount. Nasdaq futures were up 0.2%. All three were still enjoying the supportive tone from Tuesdayâ€™s rally in bonds after March inflation data failed to generate a negative shock.
 
 In addition to the banks, Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ: ), Hooker Furniture (NASDAQ: ) and Infosys (NYSE: ) are also all set to report earnings before the open. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powellâ€™s address to the Economic Club of New York at 12 PM ET will also generate headlines, but is unlikely to add much to current knowledge about the central bankâ€™s thinking.
 
 4. J&J vaccine hitch poses new threat to EU inoculation progress
 
 The European Commission is to end its contracts with both Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) and AstraZeneca (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) when they expire, according to the Italian newspaper La Stampa.
 
 J&J said it would pause the rollout of its vaccine in Europe on Tuesday after U.S. health authorities recommended a pause on administering it while possible links to rare but severe blood clots are investigated. Both vaccines are based on adenovirus-based technology.
 
 J&J had contracted to supply enough vaccine to protect over 50 million people in the EU in the second quarter, over a quarter of the blocâ€™s total vaccination schedule for the next three months. As such, it threatens to delay further the attainment of herd immunity, something that could seriously undermined the blocâ€™s attempts to salvage the summer tourism season. EasyJet said earlier it expects to fly 20% of its total capacity in the three months through June, up from only 14% during the winter season.
 
 5. IEA raises oil demand forecasts; EIA inventories due
 
 The International Energy Agency followed OPEC in raising its forecasts for global oil demand this year, by an average of 230,000 barrels a day from its March forecasts.
 
 However, it too pushed most of the increase back to the second half of the year, in view of the ongoing pandemic-related headwinds. The IEA said it expects a further 2 million barrels a day of capacity will be needed to come online in the second half above and beyond what the OPEC+ group has already agreed to release.
 
 By 6:30 AM ET, futures were up 1.6% at $61.17 a barrel, their highest in 10 days, while was up 1.6% at $64.70 a barrel. U.S. government inventory data are due at 10:30 AM ET as usual, and are expected to show a 2.9 million barrel decline in crude stocks last week. 2/2 Â© Reuters.

 MILAN (Reuters) - The EU Commission has decided not to renew COVID-19 vaccine contracts next year with companies such as Astrazeneca (LON: ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) (J&J), Italian daily La Stampa reported on Wednesday citing a source from the Italian Health Ministry.
 
 ""The European Commission, in agreement with the leaders of many (EU) countries, has decided that the contracts with the companies that produce (viral vector) vaccines that are valid for the current year will not be renewed at their expiry,"" the newspaper reported.
 
 It added that Brussels would rather focus on COVID-19 vaccines using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, such as Pfizer (NYSE: )'s and Moderna (NASDAQ: )'s.

 Investing.com -- Stocks wobbled on Monday as good news on vaccine rollouts and reopenings across the U.S. blunted concerns about interest rates.
 
 Energy stocks helped the overcome losses on the tech side, while oil prices climbed even after the Colonial Pipeline said it was back online. This is a big week for retail earnings, with Walmart Inc (NYSE: ) kicking things off.
 
 President Joe Biden announced the U.S. would ship 80 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine abroad, including 60 million doses of AstraZeneca PLC (LON: )â€™s vaccine that still awaits approval. Some 20 million doses of Pfizer Inc (NYSE: ), Moderna Inc (NASDAQ: ), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) vaccines will be sent by the end of June.
 
 New Yorkâ€™s Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the state would lift the mask mandate as of Wednesday.
 
 The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its latest meeting on Wednesday, and investors will be waiting to see what they say about inflation expectations.
 
 Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:
 
 1. Walmart earnings
 
 Walmart kicks off a week of retail earnings. Analysts tracked by Investing.com expect profit of $1.21 a share on revenue of $132.2 billion. Analysts will be watching for trends in its membership service, Walmart+, what effect stimulus checks had on sales, and what the outlook for sales is given rising consumer prices.
 
 2. Home Depot earnings
 
 Home Depot Inc (NYSE: )is seen reporting earnings of $3.06 a share on revenue of $34.6 billion. The home improvement retailer had a booming year during the pandemic as people took to do-it-yourself projects and as moved houses. Analysts will be listening for the outlook, especially given the red-hot housing market.
 
 3. Macy's earnings
 
 Macyâ€™s Inc (NYSE: ) is expected to report a loss of 39 cents a share on revenue of $4.3 billion, according to analysts tracked by Investing.com.

 (Reuters) - A major British study into mixing COVID-19 vaccines has found that people had a better immune response when they received a first dose of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) or Pfizer-BioNTech shots followed by Moderna (NASDAQ: ) nine weeks later, according to the results on Monday.
 
 ""We found a really good immune response across the board..., in fact, higher than the threshold set by Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine two doses,"" Matthew Snape, the Oxford professor behind the trial dubbed Com-COV2, told Reuters.
 
 The findings supporting flexible dosing will offer some hope to poor and middle income countries which may need to combine different brands between first and second shots if supplies run low or become unstable.
 
 ""I think the data from this study will be especially interesting and valuable to low- and middle-income countries where they're still rolling out the first two doses of vaccines,"" Snape said.
 
 ""We're showing...you don't have to stick rigidly to receiving the same vaccine for a second dose...and that if the programme will be delivered more quickly by using multiple vaccines, then it is okay to do so.""
 
 If the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is followed by a Moderna or Novavax shot, higher antibodies and T-cell responses were induced versus two doses of AstraZeneca-Oxford, according to researchers at the University of Oxford.
 
 The study of 1,070 volunteers also found that a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine followed by a Moderna shot was better than two doses of the standard Pfizer-BioNTech course.
 
 Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Novavax induced higher antibodies than the two-dose Oxford-AstraZeneca schedule, although this schedule induced lower antibody and T-cell responses than the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech schedule.
 
 No safety concerns were raised, according to the Oxford University study published in the Lancet medical journal.
 
 Many countries have been deploying a mix and match well before robust data was available as nations were faced with soaring infection numbers, low supplies and slow immunisation over some safety concerns.
 
 Longevity of protection offered by vaccines has been under scrutiny, with booster doses being considered as well amid surging cases. New variants, including Delta and Omicron, have now increased the pressure to speed up vaccination campaigns.
 
 Blood samples from participants were tested against the Wild-Type, Beta and Delta variants, researchers of the Com-COV2 study said, adding that vaccines' efficacy against the variants had waned, but this was consistent across mixed courses.
 
 Deploying vaccines using technology from different platforms - like Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna's mRNA, AstraZeneca's viral vector and Novavax's protein-based shot - and within the same schedule is new.
 
 The results may inform new approaches to immunisation against other diseases, he said.
 
 The study also found that a first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine followed by any of the other candidates in the study generated a particularly robust response, consistent with findings in June.
 
 The study was designed as a so-called ""non-inferiority"" study â€“ the intent is to demonstrate that mixing is not substantially worse than the standard schedules - and compares the immune system responses to the gold-standard responses reported in previous clinical trials of each vaccine.",Â Reuters UK shares higher at close of trade Investingcom United Kingdom 100 up 148    FERG 149 Add

 NEW YORK (Reuters) -Wall Street edged higher and the dollar dipped to its lowest in more than two years on Wednesday, the penultimate trading day in a remarkable year of pandemic, recession and recovery.
 
 All three major U.S. stock indexes were up modestly as recently enacted stimulus and the ongoing rollout of COVID-19 vaccines fed optimism over economic recovery in 2021.

 ""Once there's the sense of an all-clear sign, we would anticipate a robust response from the consumer,"" Keator added.
 
 For now, Keator suggests the markets are in wait-and-see mode.
 
 ""The markets are saying 'what have you done for me lately?' and people are going to be focusing on what's going to happen if we see more and more restrictions due to the pandemic,"" he said.

 By John Revill
 
 GENEVA (Reuters) - Health officials around the world gave their backing to the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccine against COVID-19, after a study showing it had little effect against mild disease caused by the variant now spreading quickly in South Africa rang global alarm.
 
 The prospect that new virus variants could evolve the ability to elude vaccines is one of the main risks hanging over the global strategy to emerge from the pandemic by rolling out vaccines this year.
 
 South Africa, where a new variant now accounts for the vast bulk of cases, initially announced a pause in its rollout of a million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
 
 But it said on Monday it could still roll it out in a ""stepped manner"", giving out 100,000 doses and monitoring it to see if it prevents hospitalisations and deaths.
 
 ""It is vastly too early to be dismissing this vaccine,"" said Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a foundation that co-leads the global COVAX programme to provide vaccine doses in poor countries.
 
 More than 330 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine form the overwhelming majority of doses that COVAX aims to begin rolling out in a first phase in poor countries beginning as soon as this month.
 
 ""Obviously the world is full of the wild type virus that this Astrazeneca (LON: ) vaccine is known to work against,"" Hatchett said.
 
 Professor Salim Abdool Karim, co-chair of South Africaâ€™s Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID-19, said it was too early to conclude that the AstraZeneca would not prevent serious disease caused by the variant prevalent there.
 
 If the vaccine does not work well against new evolving variants of the virus, it could be an ominous sign for other vaccines as well, showing that the virus can potentially thwart the efforts of scientists to fight it.
 
 The overall message from the World Health Organization and others was: don't panic. Several global health officials noted that the South African study was small and had tested the vaccine using a short four-week interval between the first and second doses, despite evidence having since emerged that it works better if there is a longer wait.
 
 It was becoming ""more and more clear, the longer the interval between the two doses the higher the efficacy,"" said Kate O'Brien, head of immunisations at the WHO.
 
 The lead investigator on the South African trial told Reuters he believed the vaccine had a major role to play in Africa and globally, and the 1 million doses in South Africa, which expire in April, should be rolled out quickly, not wasted.
 
 SERIOUS INFECTIONS
 
 Western governments spoke out in favour of the vaccine, which many have given approval.
 
 The vaccine is the main pillar of the vaccination programme in Britain, which has so far been the fastest of any large country to vaccinate members of the public. It is dealing mainly with another fast-spreading variant which the vaccine has been shown to work well against.
 
 ""We think that both the vaccines that we're currently using are effective in, as I say, in stopping serious disease and death,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters. Britain is also using Pfizer (NYSE: )'s vaccine.
 
 Olivier Veran, health minister in France which is hoping that the vaccine will held speed up a programme that has lagged behind other rich countries, said the AstraZeneca vaccine provided sufficient protection against ""nearly all the variants"" of the virus.
 
 But if vaccines do not work as effectively as hoped against new and emerging variants, then the world could be facing a much longer - and more expensive - battle against the virus than previously thought.
 
 The variant dominant in South Africa is circulating in at least 40 other countries, including the United States.
 
 Austria warned against non-essential travel to its Alpine province of Tyrol because of an outbreak of the South African variant. Cases were also detected north of Paris, forcing one school to close. Â© Reuters.

 Investing.com â€“ The UKâ€™s was higher heading towards midday as miners and financials once again push the index upwards. Cyclical sectors were all firmly in the green on prospects for higher growth in the coming months as the global vaccine effort continues to pick up pace. Miners lead the index higher with Anglo American PLC (LON: ) and EVRAZ plc (LON: ) the two best performing stocks in the UK blue-chip index.
 
 Financials were also strong in a continuation of the move seen at the end of last week. Lloyds Banking Group PLC (LON: ) has benefitted from an upgrade at Goldman Sachs who took their rating to neutral from sell. NatWest Group PLC (LON: ) were also higher but HSBC Holdings PLC (LON: ) underperformed their banking counterparts. Shares were flat after the company came under scrutiny after they froze the accounts of Hong Kong activist Ted Hui and his family.
 
 Rolls-Royce
 
 Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (LON: ) props up the index after reports that the company is considering plans to temporarily close its jet engine plants during the summer amid heavy losses. A decline in air travel has impacted sales for Rolls-Royce as engines have travelled fewer miles since the pandemic began.
 
 AIM-listed Omega Diagnostics Group Plc (LON: ) has been one of the best performers in the UK after that the company has been selected to provide additional lateral flow tests to the UK.
 
 AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) shares have been relatively unreactive to reports that their vaccine is less effective against the new South African variant of the coronavirus. South Africa stopped administering the vaccine after initial data but the government has tried to calm the situation in the UK, emphasising that the most dominant strains in the UK are not the South African strains.

Basingstoke    AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 177 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    By John Revill    GENEVA Reuters  Health officials around the world gave their backing to the AstraZeneca NASDAQ  vaccine against COVID19 after a study showing it had little effect against mild disease caused by the variant now spreading quickly in South Africa rang global alarm    The prospect that new virus variants could evolve the ability to elude vaccines is one of the main risks hanging over the global strategy to emerge from the pandemic by rolling out vaccines this year    South Africa where a new variant now accounts for the vast bulk of cases initially announced a pause in its rollout of a million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine    But it said on Monday it could still roll it out in a stepped manner giving out 100000 doses and monitoring it to see if it prevents hospitalisations and deaths    It is vastly too early to be dismissing this vaccine said Richard Hatchett CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations a foundation that coleads the global COVAX programme to provide vaccine doses in poor countries    More than 330 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine form the overwhelming majority of doses that COVAX aims to begin rolling out in a first phase in poor countries beginning as soon as this month    Obviously the world is full of the wild type virus that this Astrazeneca LON  vaccine is known to work against Hatchett said    Professor Salim Abdool Karim cochair of South Africaâs Ministerial Advisory Committee on COVID19 said it was too early to conclude that the AstraZeneca would not prevent serious disease caused by the variant prevalent there    If the vaccine does not work well against new evolving variants of the virus it could be an ominous sign for other vaccines as well showing that the virus can potentially thwart the efforts of scientists to fight it    The overall message from the World Health Organization and others was don't panic Several global health officials noted that the South African study was small and had tested the vaccine using a short fourweek interval between the first and second doses despite evidence having since emerged that it works better if there is a longer wait    It was becoming more and more clear the longer the interval between the two doses the higher the efficacy said Kate O'Brien head of immunisations at the WHO    The lead investigator on the South African trial told Reuters he believed the vaccine had a major role to play in Africa and globally and the 1 million doses in South Africa which expire in April should be rolled out quickly not wasted    SERIOUS INFECTIONS    Western governments spoke out in favour of the vaccine which many have given approval    The vaccine is the main pillar of the vaccination programme in Britain which has so far been the fastest of any large country to vaccinate members of the public It is dealing mainly with another fastspreading variant which the vaccine has been shown to work well against    We think that both the vaccines that we're currently using are effective in as I say in stopping serious disease and death British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters Britain is also using Pfizer NYSE 's vaccine    Olivier Veran health minister in France which is hoping that the vaccine will held speed up a programme that has lagged behind other rich countries said the AstraZeneca vaccine provided sufficient protection against nearly all the variants of the virus    But if vaccines do not work as effectively as hoped against new and emerging variants then the world could be facing a much longer  and more expensive  battle against the virus than previously thought    The variant dominant in South Africa is circulating in at least 40 other countries including the United States    Austria warned against nonessential travel to its Alpine province of Tyrol because of an outbreak of the South African variant

 Investing.com -- U.S. President Joe Bidenâ€™s tax plans may hit fewer companies than his campaign promises suggested: new details from the Treasury are supporting tech stocks as Wall Street gets ready to open. U.S. jobless claims are expected to have resumed their downward trend last week, while Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak later. AstraZeneca shares rise despite the fact that concerns about its Covid-19 vaccineâ€™s safety refuse to go away. And crude oil still canâ€™t get through $60 a barrel. Hereâ€™s what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, April 8th.
 
 1. Biden softens tax plan
 
 President Joe Bidenâ€™s plans to tax companies more are turning out less ambitious than his election campaign promises suggested.
 
 The U.S. Treasury released further details of its plans on Wednesday, the 15% minimum tax proposed last week by Janet Yellen would only apply to companies with over $2 billion in annual income, rather than the $100 million touted last year.
 
 The proposals have breathed life into a multilateral push to agree a common framework for corporate taxation. G20 finance ministers discussed the issue on Wednesday and are now again aiming for an agreement by July. The initiative, which is nearly a decade old, has missed many such deadlines already, but if it comes to fruition, it could avert the creation of national taxes on digital service companies, removing one major bone of contention between the U.S. and Europe.
 
 2. Jobless claims due, Powell speech eyed
 
 The latest weekâ€™s jobless claims data hit the wires at 8:30 AM ET (1230 GMT), and are expected to resume their downward trend after an unexpected jump to 719,000 last week. Analysts expect 680,000 initial jobless claims, which would be the second-lowest since the pandemic started.
 
 The data have suggested that the pandemic is by no means through in killing jobs across the country, but steady declines in broader measures of continuing claims and a sharp rise in hiring and job vacancies have indicated that the labor market is now clearly building momentum.
 
 Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Chairman is expected to speak at 12 PM ET at the International Monetary Fundâ€™s virtual spring meeting, but is unlikely to add much to the minutes from the last Fed policy meeting that were released on Wednesday.
 
 3. Stocks set to open higher; tech supported by tax plans
 
 U.S. stock markets are set to open higher later, after two days of drift, with the softening of President Bidenâ€™s tax plans improving sentiment toward Big Tech names somewhat.
 
 By 6:15 AM ET, were effectively flat, up a mere 10 points, but were up 0.3% and were up 0.8%.
 
 Stocks likely to be in focus later include brewer Constellation Brands (NYSE: ), whose outlook will be colored by the expected impact of economic reopening, and food company . The two are both scheduled to release quarterly earnings at 7:30 AM ET.
 
 4. AstraZeneca stock rises even as vaccine fears refuse to go away
 
 Shares in AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) rose 2.9% in London trading after an updated statement from European medical regulators turned out less negatively than some had feared.
 
 The European Union and U.K. now both acknowledge a possible link between the vaccine and potentially dangerous blot clotting disorders, but both still argue that the risks of taking it are outweighed by its benefits. The U.K.â€™s Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency has identified 19 deaths from such blood clots, after having dispensed 20 million shots of the AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) jab.
 
 The vaccine has the most advance orders worldwide of any Covid-19 drug due to AZâ€™s policy of selling it at cost price while the pandemic lasts. As such, any evidence that it is fundamentally unsafe would be a threat to vaccination campaigns in poorer countries. That is all the more important given that it countries such as India and Brazil are currently experiencing their worst wave of Covid-19 cases.
 
 5. Oil struggles despite inventory reports
 
 Crude oil prices continue to struggle below $60 a barrel, amid fears that Covid-19 waves in India and South America will slow the recovery in global demand.
 
 Bullish headlines on inventories, which fell by more than expected last week, were also undermined by less encouraging developments in gasoline trends, raising questions about the strength of final demand.
 
 By 6:15 AM ET, U.S. crude futures were down 0.8% at $59.30 a barrel, while futures were down 0.5% at $62.84 a barrel.",https://uk.investing.com//news/economy/jobless-claims-powell-astrazeneca-vaccine--whats-moving-markets-2341959,0.085,0.848,0.067,-0.9688,"Â© Reuters

 Investing.com â€“ Two major global investment banks have provided updated recommendations on AstraZeneca (LON: ) shares in the wake of the recent news regarding the vaccine. Both Citigroup (NYSE: ) and UBS have maintained shares at a â€˜Buyâ€™ rating.
 
 Although the vaccine maker has offered to sell the initial vaccine doses at cost, there is a risk of reputational damage regarding the vaccine safety. This week, the UK and EU regulators acknowledged that there could be a link between extremely rare but potentially fatal blood clots and the AstraZeneca jab.
 
 With the company in the headlines, policymakers and officials from various countries have been defending the companyâ€™s vaccine. The UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke about how the risk of a blood clot from the vaccine is about the same as on a long-haul flight and urged people to continue to take it. The UK Prime Minister Johnson echoed those comments, despite the UK vaccine taskforce recommending that those aged under 30 take a different jab.
 
 It is not just officials and politicians out defending the company, but also the big banks.
 
 Citigroup on AstraZeneca
 
 In a research note on Thursday, Citigroup maintained its â€˜Buyâ€™ rating on the stock with a target price of Â£100.00. The bank said it was also going to maintain its forecast of $1.3bln worth of revenue from Roxadustat in 2030. This news comes amid an admission by FibroGen (NASDAQ: ) earlier this week that they had misstated some data on the anaemia drug the two companies are working on. Fibrogen shares fell 43% on Wednesday following the announcement.
 
 UBS
 
 Swiss banking giant UBS also kept its â€˜Buyâ€™ rating on the shares, although the price target is lower at Â£80.00.

 (Reuters) - A British public health study has found that protection from either of the two most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines against the now prevalent Delta variant of the coronavirus weakens within three months.
 
 It also found that those who get infected after receiving two shots of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccine may be of greater risk to others than under previous variants of the coronavirus.
 
 Based on more than three million nose and throat swabs taken across Britain, the Oxford University study found that 90 days after a second shot of the Pfizer (NYSE: ) or Astrazeneca (LON: ) vaccine, their efficacy in preventing infections had slipped to 75% and 61% respectively.
 
 That was down from 85% and 68%, respectively, seen two weeks after a second dose. The decline in efficacy was more pronounced among those aged 35 years and older than those below that age.
 
 ""Both of these vaccines, at two doses, are still doing really well against Delta... When you start very, very high, you got a long way to go,"" said Sarah Walker, an Oxford professor of medical statistics and chief investigator for the survey https://www.ndm.ox.ac.uk/covid-19/covid-19-infection-survey/results/new-studies.
 
 Walker was not involved in work on AstraZeneca's vaccine, which was initially developed by immunology experts at Oxford.
 
 The researchers would not project how much more the protection would drop over time, but suggested that the efficacy of the two vaccines studied would converge within 4-5 months after the second shot.
 
 VIRAL LOAD
 
 Highlighting the increased risk of contagion from the Delta variant, the study also showed that those who do get infected despite being fully vaccinated tend to have a viral load similar to the unvaccinated with an infection, a clear deterioration from when the Alpha variant was still dominant in Britain.
 
 The Oxford findings are in line with an analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and come as the U.S. government outlines plans to make COVID-19 vaccine booster shots widely available next month amid a rise in Delta variant infections. It has cited data indicating diminishing protection from the vaccines over time.
 
 Israel began administering third Pfizer doses last month to confront a surge in local infections driven by Delta. Several European countries are also expected to begin offering boosters to the elderly and people with weak immune systems.
 
 Pfizer has said its vaccine's efficacy drops over time. Last month AstraZeneca said it was still looking into how long its vaccine's protection lasts and whether a booster dose would be needed to keep up immunity.
 
 ""The fact that we do see ... more viral load hints (...) that indeed herd immunity might become more challenging,"" said co-author Koen Pouwels, also of Oxford University.
 
 Herd immunity is when a large enough portion of the population is immune to a pathogen, either by vaccination or prior infection, stopping infection numbers from growing.
 
 ""Vaccines are probably best at preventing severe disease and slightly less at preventing transmission,"" said Pouwels.
 
 The authors cautioned that the viral concentration in the throat was only a rough proxy for severity of symptoms and that they had no new data on the duration of infections.
 
 The survey, which has yet to be peer-reviewed before publication in a scientific journal, underscores concerns by scientists that the Delta variant, first identified in India, can infect fully vaccinated people at a greater rate than previous lineages, and that the vaccinated could more easily transmit it.
 
 To contrast periods before and after Delta became prevalent, the Oxford researchers analysed about 2.58 million swabs taken from 380,000 randomly picked adults between Dec. 1, 2020, and May 16, 2021, and 810,000 test results from 360,000 participants between May 17 and Aug. 1.

 Investing.com â€“ The trades in the red heading towards the North American crossover with little in the way of fresh catalysts to drive near term market direction. The same can be said for other European bourses with most major bourses trading marginally lower. The current situation is dominated by vaccine rollout, ongoing hopes for US fiscal stimulus, the current Covid-19 picture and the how effective the current vaccines are against the new strains.
 
 In the UK, the Covid-19 picture is improving, albeit slowly, and the vaccine rollout has been promising so far. Nevertheless, there are fears that the Oxford/AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) jab is less effective against the South African variant. The director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Andrew Pollard, spoke to the BBC earlier and tried to reassure people that the vaccine is still effective. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any reason for alarm today,â€ Pollard said.
 
 In individual stocks news, Ocado Group PLC (LON: ) props up the blue-chip index after a pre-market. The technology/grocery delivery company provided strong retail revenue growth but announced total capex is expected to be around Â£700mln as they build more automated warehouses.
 
 Oil companies are strong with BP PLC (LON: ) and Royal Dutch Shell PLC Class A (LON: ) higher as energy prices remain elevated. hold firm above $60/barrel although trades off its highest levels ahead of the report after market in the US.
 
 The USD is weaker which is providing support for and is looking to test 1.38 to the upside. The GBP earlier hit its highest level against the USD since April 2018, although is weaker against the EUR today. Markets are still pushing back expectations for a rate cut from the Bank of England following the central bankâ€™s announcement last week.

 RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - One question rippled through the queue outside a makeshift inoculation center in Rio de Janeiro's beachside neighborhood of Copacabana on a recent morning: ""Which vaccine are they using?""
 
 Despite the world's second-highest death toll and infections running high, people across Brazil are refusing to receive their shot if the vaccine being used is not to their satisfaction.
 
 Local media have dubbed them ""the vaccine sommeliers"".
 
 There are no official figures on the total number of people cherry-picking their vaccines, but dozens of towns in Brazil have sought to crack down on the practice, taking the names of those who refuse to be inoculated with the shot on offer and moving them to the back of the queue.
 
 Public health experts in Brazil say the practice and the misinformation - or poorly understood information - that fuels it, is threatening to undermine the country's vaccination campaign.
 
 It is also, they say, very selfish.
 
 ""The person is putting themselves at risk and ends up putting the entire system in danger,"" said Alexandre Naime Barbosa, an infectious diseases professor at SÃ£o Paulo State University. ""It shows a lack of empathy, an enormous selfishness.""
 
 The trend comes as many countries have already vaccinated most of their populations and are lifting restrictions.
 
 The Brazilian Society of Immunizations said most incidents involve people refusing vaccines from China's Sinovac or - to a lesser extent - Astrazeneca (LON: ). Instead they seek out shots from Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ).
 
 WhatsApp groups have popped up with people swapping tips on which vaccination centers are offering the more sought-after shots.
 
 Some are worried Sinovac's CoronaVac does not work as well, while others fear Europe and the U.S. might not recognize it as travel restrictions are lifted for the fully vaccinated.
 
 Brazilian health experts are rushing to dispel concerns, particularly about CoronaVac, fighting a wave of criticism including from President Jair Bolsonaro who said of the Chinese vaccine's use earlier this month: ""It didn't work out.""
 
 Late-stage trials in Brazil found CoronaVac to have a 50% efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection, compared to 76% for Astrazeneca and 95% for Pfizer.
 
 But in a real-world context, public health experts here argue, CoronaVac has shown itself to be very effective in reducing hospitalisation and death.
 
 ""When you look at what really matters, reducing the number of hospitalizations and deaths, all the vaccines we have in Brazil have a very high efficacy,"" Barbosa said.
 
 In Serrana, a town in Sao Paulo state, where almost the entire adult population were vaccinated with CoronaVac as part of a study, deaths were reduced by 95%. Hospitalizations fell 86% and symptomatic infections by 80%.
 
 Public health experts have also stressed that the risk of developing blood clots as a result of taking the Astrazeneca vaccine are incredibly rare.
 
 No vaccine, scientists stress, ever entirely removes the chance of death.
 
 ""Choosing your vaccine is an ignorant gesture that lacks commitment to public health,"" said Dimas Covas, the president of the Butantan Institute which is producing CoronaVac in Brazil.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/picky-vaccine-sommeliers-undermine-brazil-inoculation-campaign-experts-say-2413329,0.132,0.843,0.024,-0.9965,"Â© Reuters.

 OSLO (Reuters) - Pfizer (NYSE: ) has cut July deliveries of its COVID-19 vaccine to Norway by 400,000 doses, delaying the Nordic country's vaccine rollout, the company and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) told Reuters on Thursday.
 
 The news was first reported by Norwegian daily VG, citing Pfizer's Norwegian arm, and Geir Bukholm, Director of Infection Prevention and Control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health.
 
 Pfizer, a major provider of vaccines to Norway which has dropped Astrazeneca (LON: )'s jab and only offering J&J (NYSE: )'s Jenssen vaccine under certain conditions, will now provide 800,000 doses in July, from the earlier estimated 1.2 million doses, Pfizer Norway confirmed to Reuters.
 
 As a consequence, Norway's vaccination programme will be delayed by one to two weeks compared to its earlier estimate, FHI said.

 Investing.com -- Global markets tumble and U.S. stocks are set to extend losses after the Federal Reserve's latest minutes suggested it will start reducing its bond purchases this year. Jobless claims are due to provide further evidence of ""substantial progress"" (or not) toward the Fed's employment goals. The world's two biggest auto groups see chip-related disruptions continuing, while a new study supports the scientific case for vaccine booster shots. And in China, the country's biggest investor avoided collapse by accepting a state-led bailout. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 19th August.
 
 1. Global markets fall after Fed minutes point to early tapering
 
 Global stock markets tumbled, taking industrial commodities with them, as the prospect of an early tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve triggered a sharp repricing of risk worldwide.
 
 The , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed market currencies, rose to its highest since November, while prices fell to their lowest in May. The biggest carnage was reserved for , which fell 12% in Singapore as China cut its steel output targets in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Other base metals also tumbled.
 
 U.S. stock markets are set to extend Wednesdayâ€™s losses when they open later. By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), were down 214 points, or 0.6%, while were down 0.5% and were down 0.4%
 
 2. Jobless claims to show 'substantial' progress?
 
 The market nerves will add extra spice to the release of U.S. numbers at 8:30 AM ET. Initial claims are expected to have fallen to a new post-pandemic low of 363,000 from 375,000 last week.
 
 The numbers are the most up-to-the-minute data from the labour market, which has been the Fedâ€™s chief cause for concern in recent months â€“ at least until the banner employment report for July, when leaped by nearly 1 million.
 
 The Fedâ€™s minutes, released late on Wednesday, suggested that a majority of policymakers thought enough progress had been made in restoring employment to start reducing the rate of bond purchases as early as this year.
 
 3. Study boosts booster shot, while WHO continues to rail against them
 
 A major U.K. study showed that the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in stopping disease fades more quickly than thought, strengthening the scientific case for the booster shots being planned by governments in the U.S. and U.K.
 
 The study, led by Oxford University, found that the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fell by half within four months of the second shot being administered. The AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) vaccineâ€™s protection degraded at a slightly slower rate.

 The impact of the latest wave of the pandemic was evident in a report that said Toyota will be forced to cut its production to 40% below planned levels in September.

 The excessive debts of Chinese companies are slowly but surely finding their way onto the stateâ€™s balance sheet.
 
 Huarong, the countryâ€™s largest investor in distressed debt, announced on Thursday that it will accept a bailout by a handful of largely state-owned institutions including CITIC and China Life. The news coincided with the delayed publication of a record loss for 2020.
 
 The capital injection removes the threat of a damaging high-profile default from the local bond market, which remains plagued by fears that any number of highly-leveraged companies â€“ especially in the real estate sector â€“ could go under.

 Investing.com -- Global markets tumble and U.S. stocks are set to extend losses after the Federal Reserve's latest minutes suggested it will start reducing its bond purchases this year. Jobless claims are due to provide further evidence of ""substantial progress"" (or not) toward the Fed's employment goals. The world's two biggest auto groups see chip-related disruptions continuing, while a new study supports the scientific case for vaccine booster shots. And in China, the country's biggest investor avoided collapse by accepting a state-led bailout. Here's what you need to know in financial markets on Thursday, 19th August.
 
 1. Global markets fall after Fed minutes point to early tapering
 
 Global stock markets tumbled, taking industrial commodities with them, as the prospect of an early tapering of asset purchases by the Federal Reserve triggered a sharp repricing of risk worldwide.
 
 The , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six developed market currencies, rose to its highest since November, while prices fell to their lowest in May. The biggest carnage was reserved for , which fell 12% in Singapore as China cut its steel output targets in an effort to reduce carbon emissions. Other base metals also tumbled.
 
 U.S. stock markets are set to extend Wednesdayâ€™s losses when they open later. By 6:15 AM ET (1015 GMT), were down 214 points, or 0.6%, while were down 0.5% and were down 0.4%
 
 2. Jobless claims to show 'substantial' progress?
 
 The market nerves will add extra spice to the release of U.S. numbers at 8:30 AM ET. Initial claims are expected to have fallen to a new post-pandemic low of 363,000 from 375,000 last week.
 
 The numbers are the most up-to-the-minute data from the labour market, which has been the Fedâ€™s chief cause for concern in recent months â€“ at least until the banner employment report for July, when leaped by nearly 1 million.
 
 The Fedâ€™s minutes, released late on Wednesday, suggested that a majority of policymakers thought enough progress had been made in restoring employment to start reducing the rate of bond purchases as early as this year.
 
 3. Study boosts booster shot, while WHO continues to rail against them
 
 A major U.K. study showed that the effectiveness of Covid-19 vaccines in stopping disease fades more quickly than thought, strengthening the scientific case for the booster shots being planned by governments in the U.S. and U.K.
 
 The study, led by Oxford University, found that the efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine fell by half within four months of the second shot being administered. The AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) vaccineâ€™s protection degraded at a slightly slower rate.
 
 The World Health Organization remains adamantly opposed to plans for booster shorts, saying that itâ€™s more important to get vaccines to parts of the world where initial vaccination rates are still low.

 (Reuters) -London's slipped on Tuesday, weighed down by weaker shares of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and heavyweight consumer staples stocks, although upbeat earnings updates from Vodafone (LON: ) and spirits maker Diageo (LON: ) limited overall declines.

 (Reuters) - Two billion doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine have been supplied worldwide, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker and its partner said on Tuesday, in just under a year since its first approval.
 
 The shot, which is the biggest contributor to the COVAX vaccine sharing scheme backed by the World Health Organization, is being made in 15 countries for supply to more than 170 countries, London-listed AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and Oxford University said in a joint statement.
 
 AstraZeneca in June last year signed on India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest manufacturer of vaccines by volume, to help double the vaccine's manufacturing capacity to two billion doses.
 
 The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 shot, sold under the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield, has faced challenges around efficacy data, supplies and links to rare blood clots.
 
 AstraZeneca last week said as the world learns to live with the coronavirus which causes COVID-19, it would begin to earn a modest profit from the shot after having made a commitment to sell it at cost during the pandemic.
 
 The company's chief executive officer, Pascal Soriot, however, reassured that low-income countries would continue to receive vaccines on a non-profit basis.",Â Reuters FILE PHOTO Pedestrians leave and enter the London Stock Exchange in London Britain August 15 2017 REUTERSNeil HallFile Photo    UK100 203 Add toRemove from a Portfolio VOD 227 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio FTSE 203 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    By Bansari Mayur Kamdar and Devik Jain    Reuters London's slipped on Tuesday weighed down by weaker shares of AstraZeneca NASDAQ  and heavyweight consumer staples stocks although upbeat earnings updates from Vodafone LON  and spirits maker Diageo LON  limited overall declines    The bluechip index closed 03 lower with drugmakers AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline down 41 and 19 respectively    Large dollarearning companies including British American Tobacco LON  Reckitt Benckiser and Unilever LON  fell and were among the biggest drags on the index    Vodafone jumped 48 to top the FTSE 100 as the mobile operator increased its free cash flow outlook after it reported a solid growth in earnings in its first half    The domestically focussed midcap ended 04 lower shrugging off data that showed the UK economy withstood the end of the government's furlough scheme last month cementing expectations of an interest rate hike in December    We still seem to be caught between two strong counterforces a strong earnings season providing the bullish case and a long list of downside risks  most notably inflation and interest rates  which continue to weigh on sentiment said Craig Erlam senior market analyst UK  EMEA at OANDA    What we did see from the report in relation to October payrolls was encouraging and makes the December BoE meeting very much a live one    Financial markets have currently priced in a near 100 chance that the Bank of England BoeE raise rates to 025 from 01 in December    Bogged down by inflationary pressures and supply chain problems the FTSE 100 has gained just 135 this year underperforming its European and US peers    The focus is now on consumer prices data on Wednesday    Among other stocks Diageo added 12 as the Johnnie Walker whisky maker forecast double digit sales growth in first half    Restaurant Group Plc LON  climbed 168 after the Wagamama owner raised its annual profit outlook    Land Securities Group gained 37 after UK's largest commercial property firm swung to a halfyear profit Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A woman reacts as she receives an AstraZenecaOxford coronavirus disease COVID19 vaccine donated to Kenya by the UK government in Nairobi Kenya August 8 2021 REUTERSBaz Ratner    AZN 056 Add toRemove from a Portfolio    Reuters  Two billion doses of the AstraZenecaOxford University COVID19 vaccine have been supplied worldwide the AngloSwedish drugmaker and its partner said on Tuesday in just under a year since its first approval    The shot which is the biggest contributor to the COVAX vaccine sharing scheme backed by the World Health Organization is being made in 15 countries for supply to more than 170 countries Londonlisted AstraZeneca NASDAQ  and Oxford University said in a joint statement    AstraZeneca in June last year signed on India's Serum Institute the world's biggest manufacturer of vaccines by volume to help double the vaccine's manufacturing capacity to two billion doses    The ChAdOx1 nCoV19 shot sold under the brand names Vaxzevria and Covishield has faced challenges around efficacy data supplies and links to rare blood clots    AstraZeneca last week said as the world learns to live with the coronavirus which causes COVID19 it would begin to earn a modest profit from the shot after having made a commitment to sell it at cost during the pandemic    The company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot however reassured that lowincome countries would continue to receive vaccines on a nonprofit basis,0.307827380952381,0.08643127705627704

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday cemented its lead in bringing a preventative COVID-19 shot to market, saying its antibody cocktail offered 83% protection over six months, providing another possible weapon in the fight against the pandemic.
 
 The therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77% protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-antibody-works-prevent-treat-covid-19-longer-term-studies-2021-11-18 in August.
 
 The data give hope of additional protection for people who do not respond well to vaccines, such as cancer patients.
 
 The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88% when given within three days of the first symptoms.
 
 The antibody treatment, enhanced to remain intact in the body for months, is given in one go, as two sequential shots in the arm.
 
 The latest results from the longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca, like rival Pfizer (NYSE: ) as a future supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy's ""real advantage"" was as a preventative shot.
 
 The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
 
 Pfizer https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-files-us-authorization-covid-19-pill-2021-11-16 has presented promising efficacy data on its oral COVID-19 treatment candidate, which can be more easily distributed than injections, and is also a leading vaccine supplier with partner BioNTech.
 
 ""These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442's potential ...

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday cemented its lead in bringing a preventative COVID-19 shot to market, saying its antibody cocktail offered 83% protection over six months, providing another possible weapon in the fight against the pandemic.
 
 The therapy, called AZD7442 or Evusheld, had previously been shown to confer 77% protection against symptomatic illness after three months, in an earlier readout of the late-stage PROVENT trial https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-antibody-works-prevent-treat-covid-19-longer-term-studies-2021-11-18 in August.
 
 The data give hope of additional protection for people who do not respond well to vaccines, such as cancer patients.
 
 The Anglo-Swedish company also said a separate study in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 showed a higher dose of AZD7442 cut the risk of symptoms worsening by 88% when given within three days of the first symptoms.
 
 The antibody treatment, enhanced to remain intact in the body for months, is given in one go, as two sequential shots in the arm.
 
 The latest results from the longer-term follow-ups potentially position AstraZeneca, like rival Pfizer (NYSE: ) as a future supplier of both COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, with AstraZeneca having said the therapy's ""real advantage"" was as a preventative shot.
 
 The full results will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
 
 Pfizer https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-files-us-authorization-covid-19-pill-2021-11-16 has presented promising efficacy data on its oral COVID-19 treatment candidate, which can be more easily distributed than injections, and is also a leading vaccine supplier with partner BioNTech.
 
 ""These new data add to the growing body of evidence supporting AZD7442's potential ...

 CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) -Britain's Prince Charles formally opened a new 1 billion pound ($1.3 billion) AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) research and development (R&D) facility in Cambridge, eastern England, on Tuesday, as the company aims to fuel the growth of its drug pipeline.
 
 AstraZeneca has supplied two billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, developed at Oxford University, and is also looking to bring a preventative antibody cocktail against COVID-19 to market.
 
 Prince Charles, son of Queen Elizabeth and heir to the throne, saw an exhibit on the pandemic and a demonstration of how augmented reality headsets can help with lab work, before hearing about the company's net-zero targets.
 
 ""The last two years have been some of the most difficult of a generation,"" Prince Charles said in a speech.
 
 ""But if we can quite literally turbo-charge the sustainable action so desperately needed, we can create a greener, healthier future â€“ for people, Nature and our one and only planet.""
 
 Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said the centre would ""power the next stage of our company's growth.""
 
 The plans for AstraZeneca's new headquarters and large R&D campus in Cambridge were unveiled in 2013, but its costs and timeframe have exceeded the initial estimate of 330 million pounds and an aimed completion date of 2016.
 
 AstraZeneca, which has a large portfolio of treatments for diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes, said the centre would support research into specialised medicines and next-generation therapeutics, including gene-editing and cell therapies.
 
 ""We will have advances that could come to the clinic in the next three, four years, that can lead to really effective new drugs in various aspects of treating cancer,"" Dr Susan Galbraith, AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President, Oncology Research & Development, told Reuters in an interview.
 
 ""I'm very optimistic about the fact that we can make a big difference to this disease in the coming decade""

 LONDON (Reuters) -AstraZeneca said on Friday it was examining the impact of a new coronavirus variant that is spreading rapidly in South Africa on its vaccine and its antibody cocktail, adding it was hopeful its combination drug would retain efficacy.
 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday designated a new COVID-19 variant B.1.1.529, detected in South Africa with a large number of mutations, as being ""of concern"".
 
 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) has distributed 2 billion doses of its vaccine worldwide, although rollout of the shot was paused in South Africa in February after it was shown to offer minimal protection against mild to moderate illness caused by the Beta variant, which was dominant in the country at the time.
 
 ""As with any new emerging variants, we are looking into B.1.1.529 to understand more about it and the impact on the vaccine,"" AstraZeneca said in a statement, adding it was conducting research in Botswana and Eswatini to collect data.
 
 ""That will enable us to collect real world data of Vaxzevria against this new virus variant.""
 
 The Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical firm emphasised that the vaccine has been shown to be effective against all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
 
 AstraZeneca said that it had developed a vaccine platform to respond quickly to new variants with Oxford University, where the vaccine was created. It has previously said it is working on a variant vaccine to better target the Beta variant.
 
 The company has also developed an antibody cocktail which can be used both to prevent and to treat COVID-19.
 
 Although some scientists have expressed concern that the spike protein mutations might hinder the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody drugs, the combination drug made by AstraZeneca might retain its efficacy, the company said.

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Pfizer (NYSE: ) and BioNtech are set to displace AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) as the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to the global COVAX programme at the start of 2022, a shift that shows the increasing importance of their shot for poorer states.
 
 The expected change comes with headaches for receiving countries that lack sufficient cold storage capacity to handle the Pfizer vaccine, and amid risks of a shortage of syringes needed to administer that shot.
 
 AstraZeneca is currently the most distributed vaccine by COVAX, according to data from Gavi, the vaccine alliance that co-manages the programme with the World Health Organization (WHO).
 
 The programme has so far delivered more than 600 million shots to nearly 150 countries, of which more than 220 million are AstraZeneca's and about 160 million Pfizer's.
 
 But in the first quarter of next year Pfizer is set to take over, according to Gavi and WHO figures on doses assigned by the COVAX programme for future supplies.
 
 By the end of March, another 150 million Pfizer doses are to be distributed by COVAX, a WHO document shows.
 
 A spokesperson for Gavi confirmed that Pfizer is far ahead in terms of ""allocated"" jabs, with about 470 million doses delivered or readied for delivery, against 350 million from AstraZeneca.
 
 Pfizer is the first provider of COVID-19 vaccines to the European Union, the United States and Japan.
 
 It has bilateral agreements for more than 6 billion doses, making it by far the largest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines, according to data from UNICEF, a U.N. agency.
 
 But AstraZeneca has been seen as a crucial supplier to less developed countries, because its shot is cheaper and easier to deliver.
 
 COVAX bet heavily on AstraZeneca at the beginning of the pandemic, but supply problems and export restrictions from top producer India gradually reduced its reliance on the Anglo-Swedish shot.
 
 As the programme faced problems in securing doses directly from vaccine makers amid a global scramble for shots, donations from rich nations became more important, turning Pfizer into the main supplier to COVAX. The United States is donating mostly Pfizer shots to the programme.
 
 COLD CHAIN AND SYRINGES
 
 The change forced Gavi to rush to invest more in cold chain capacity in receiving countries that do not have enough refrigerators and cold transport equipment to handle the Pfizer shot, which requires lower storage temperatures than the AstraZeneca vaccine.
 
 The organization warned about insufficient cold chain capacity in some countries, according to an internal report submitted to Gavi's board at the beginning of December and seen by Reuters.
 
 The problem is compounded by a risk of shortages of special syringes needed to administer the Pfizer vaccine, Gavi warned in the document.
 
 The Pfizer jab is ""the hardest to deliver given ultra-cold chain and special syringe requirements"", Gavi says in its internal document.
 
 It is also ""the hardest to plan for as these (donated vaccines) often come with earmarking and little notice or in a staggered manner and in small volumes and with short shelf lives"", the document says.
 
 Wealthy countries donating COVID-19 vaccines with a relatively short shelf life has been a ""major problem"" for COVAX, a WHO official said last week, as many doses were wasted.
 
 An EU official told a news briefing last week that EU donations of Pfizer vaccines to COVAX were slowed by a lack of syringes. A second official familiar with the issue told Reuters that Gavi had to postpone the delivery of some Pfizer doses from Europe because of the lack of syringes.
 
 Pfizer declined to comment on syringes because it said it does not produce or buy them directly.
 
 As more doses are made available to poorer nations, UNICEF and the WHO have long been warning of the insufficient supply of the auto-disable syringes, which are crucial for inoculations in poorer nations.
 
 Auto-disable syringes lock automatically to prevent re-use, which is otherwise common in poorer nations and could spread of diseases. To make things more complicated, auto-disable syringes needed for the Pfizer vaccine are different from standard syringes, UNICEF said.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/pfizer-set-to-oust-astrazeneca-as-top-supplier-of-covid19-shots-to-poor-nations-2538093,0.08,0.869,0.051,-0.9639,"Â© Reuters.

 BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Pfizer (NYSE: ) and BioNtech are set to displace AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) as the main suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to the global COVAX programme at the start of 2022, a shift that shows the increasing importance of their shot for poorer states.

 (Reuters) - Vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII) has pledged 50 million pounds ($66.2 million) to the University of Oxford for setting up a research campus that would also house the institute behind the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 shot.
 
 The investment was made through the Indian company's Serum Life Sciences unit, Oxford University said on Wednesday. The research building would be named after Serum's billionaire owners, the Poonawalla family. The pledge builds on the collaboration between Oxford University, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and SII, the world's largest maker of vaccines and the producer of a version of the British duo's COVID-19 shot for low- and middle-income countries.
 
 SII has also agreed with the Jenner Institute, which was behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, to produce and develop Jenner's R21/Matrix-M malaria shot on a large scale. The shot is currently in late-stage trials.
 
 SII was founded in 1966 in the Western Indian city of Pune by Cyrus Poonawalla, son of a horse breeder, and India's fifth-richest person, according to Forbes. In 2019, Cyrus was also conferred an honorary degree by Oxford University.
 
 It is currently run by his son Adar Poonawalla, whose wife Natasha Poonawalla heads Serum Life Sciences. With a penchant for luxury cars and racehorses, the pair is often seen rubbing shoulders with Hollywood and Bollywood stars.
 
 The Poonawallas in September invested 50 million pounds in Oxford Biomedica to help fund the development of a plant that manufactures COVID-19 shots.

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron on Thursday reported contrasting data on the effectiveness of their COVID-19 antibody therapies against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, underscoring the major challenges ahead for drugmakers.
 
 U.S.-based Regeneron said its REGEN-COV therapy, also called Ronapreve, is less effective against Omicron, though it is still active against the Delta variant, confirming indications from lab tests and computer modelling late last month.
 
 Anglo-Swedish rival AstraZeneca, however, said a lab study found that its antibody cocktail Evusheld retained neutralising activity against Omicron, the first such data for the treatment.
 
 The new variant has been detected in 77 countries since it was first identified three weeks ago, fuelling concerns that its large number of mutations will help it spread faster and evade protection provided by COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.
 
 Earlier this week, German researchers found that COVID-19 therapies developed by Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) and Regeneron lose most of their effectiveness when exposed in laboratory tests to Omicron.
 
 But lab studies this week showed GSK-Vir's antibody treatment retains neutralizing activity against all tested coronavirus variants, including Omicron.
 
 The study on Evusheld was done by independent investigators of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration using so-called pseudoviruses that feature major coronavirus mutations across suspicious variants that have emerged so far.
 
 ROAD AHEAD
 
 The researchers found the potency of Evusheld was within the ranges seen in those previously infected with COVID-19, showing promise for wide use of the therapy, which is the first preventative shot other than vaccines against the coronavirus.
 
 AstraZeneca said more analyses of Evusheld against Omicron are being conducted by the company and third parties, with data expected ""very soon.""
 
 Regeneron said REGEN-COV is still active against Delta, which currently is the most prevalent variant in the United States.
 
 The European Union's public health body, however, warned on Wednesday that there was a ""very high"" risk Omicron would become dominant in Europe by early next year.
 
 REGEN-COV is currently authorized for use in the United States to treat people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for prevention of infection in those exposed to infected individuals, and others at high risk of exposure.
 
 Evusheld has been granted authorisation to prevent COVID-19 infections in individuals with weak immune systems or a history of severe side-effects from coronavirus vaccines.
 
 Both treatments belong to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies in fighting off infections.
 
 Unlike vaccines, they do not rely on the body to create an immune response, and can therefore help individuals with weak or compromised immune systems.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/astrazeneca-therapy-works-against-omicron-results-mixed-for-regeneron-2540179,0.075,0.828,0.097,0.7917,"2/2 Â© Reuters.

 BRUSSELS/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of millions of migrants may be denied COVID-19 vaccines from a global programme because some major manufacturers are worried about legal risks from harmful side effects, according to officials and internal documents from Gavi, the charity operating the programme, reviewed by Reuters.
 
 Nearly two years into a pandemic that has already killed more than 5 million people, only about 7% of people in low-income countries have received a dose. Vaccine deliveries worldwide have been delayed by production problems, hoarding by rich countries, export restrictions and red tape. Many programmes have also been hampered by hesitancy among the public.
 
 The legal concerns are an additional hurdle for public health officials tackling the coronavirus â€“ even as officials say unvaccinated people offer an ideal environment for it to mutate into new variants that threaten hard-won immunity around the world. Many COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers have required that countries indemnify them for any adverse events suffered by individuals as a result of the vaccines, the United Nations says.
 
 Where governments are not in control, that is not possible.
 
 The concerns affect people, such as those displaced by the Myanmar, Afghanistan and Ethiopian crises, who are beyond the reach of national governments' vaccination schemes.
 
 For refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers, as well as people afflicted by natural disasters or other events that put them out of reach of government help, the global programme known as COVAX created a Humanitarian Buffer â€“ a last-resort reserve of shots to be administered by humanitarian groups. Gavi, the vaccine alliance, is a public-private partnership set up in 2000 to promote vaccination around the world.
 
 But that buffer does not have any mechanism to offer compensation. Gavi, which operates COVAX with the World Health Organization (WHO), says that where those applying for doses, mainly NGOs, can't bear legal risks, deliveries from that stockpile can only be made if vaccine-makers accept liability.
 
 The companies that are willing to do so under these circumstances provide only a minority of the programme's vaccines, according to people familiar with the matter and the documents, written by Gavi staff for a board meeting starting at the end of November.
 
 More than two-thirds of COVAX doses have come from Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: ) and its partner BioNTech SE, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) PLC and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) Inc., Gavi says. Moderna declined to comment. AstraZeneca and Pfizer said they were in talks with Gavi but declined to comment further. All three said they are committed to making doses available to poorer nations at relatively low prices. Pfizer said it was collaborating directly with governments in Jordan and Lebanon to donate doses for refugees.
 
 Mainly because of the legal concerns, less than 2 million doses have so far been sent from the buffer, Gavi says. About 167 million people risk being excluded from national programmes, according to United Nations data cited in the documents.
 
 Unless all the firms accept legal liability, ""access to vaccines for some populations will remain a challenge,"" the Gavi documents say, adding that new crises will generate additional demand to cover displaced populations.
 
 The vaccine makers' reluctance to take on the legal risks is ""a major hurdle"" in attempts to provide vaccines for the buffer, a spokesperson for Gavi told Reuters. Gavi did not comment on the details in the documents, but said applications for vaccines are confidential until the doses are delivered. In September, Gavi's CEO, Seth Berkley, tweeted an appeal to drugmakers to waive their requirements for legal indemnity.
 
 Three Chinese drugmakers have agreed to shoulder legal risks when their shots are delivered through the buffer: SinoVac Biotech Ltd, Sinopharm Group Co. Ltd, and Clover Biopharmaceuticals Co. Ltd, according to the Gavi document. The drugmakers did not respond to requests for comment.
 
 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) of the United States confirmed it would waive a requirement for indemnity for deliveries from the buffer: ""We are proud to be part of this effort to protect the world's most vulnerable people,"" said Paul Stoffels, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer. He did not elaborate.
 
 However, less than one-third of COVAX supplies have come from these four firms, COVAX data shows: Clover's shot has not yet been approved so is not in use.
 
 The global industry association, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), said ""no company has refused to consider"" taking on the legal risk. However, in the case of shots delivered from the buffer, it said some firms felt they could not do so without full knowledge of where and how vaccines would be used.
 
 It would be hard to continuously monitor vaccines for safety in refugee camps, and delivery is logistically very challenging and not suitable for all types, said the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), which represents large pharmaceutical companies in Europe.
 
 People may blame vaccines for problems that emerge afterwards even if they are unrelated, it said.
 
 ""This could then lead to an increased number of litigation cases ... during which the safety and efficacy of the vaccine would be publicly questioned,"" it said in a statement to Reuters. That might lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and a slower recovery from the pandemic, it said.
 
 So far there is scant information on COVID vaccine litigation, but claims made to out-of-court compensation programmes are one measure of the risk. A programme in the United States has so far not paid out anything, public data show; neither has one set up by the WHO for lower income countries, the WHO said. In Europe, a handful of compensation awards have been granted for undisclosed amounts of money, official data from Denmark, Germany, Norway and Switzerland show.
 
 Globally there have been few reported COVID infections among refugees, migrants and asylum-seekers â€“ testing is not always systematic and infections can generate only mild symptoms especially in younger people.
 
 But cramped conditions and weak healthcare expose them to high infection risk. This, combined with low levels of vaccination in a mobile population could favour the emergence of new variants and be a vector for infection, said Mireille Lembwadio, Global Vaccination Coordinator at the International Organization of Migration (IOM), a U.N.-related body that advises governments and migrants.
 
 ""Leaving them unvaccinated could help spread the virus and its variants across the world,"" she said.
 
 WAITING FOR DOSES
 
 Francois Nosten, a French professor who helps coordinate healthcare for people from Myanmar living on the border with Thailand, is one of those waiting for vaccines. In June, he put in a request from the Humanitarian Buffer for 70,000 doses â€“ some for some of the 90,000 or so who are sheltering in camps along the border, but most for unregistered migrants in the border town of Mae Sot and nearby villages.
 
 Nosten, whose main work is researching malaria, is expecting the doses - a fraction of the more than 8 billion administered worldwide - this month. He has been told they will come from Sinopharm, and he hopes they can help inoculate key at-risk groups in Thailand's Tak province. Gavi said delivery arrangements are still being finalised.
 
 About 20,000 doses will be given to people in the camps by the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a humanitarian group working with Nosten.
 
 ""At this point whatever vaccine we can secure we are grateful for,"" said its Thailand Director, Darren Hertz. He added that the IRC believed the likelihood that a member of the refugee population would attempt to take legal action in case of side-effects was ""extremely low.""
 
 Hertz said the IRC has received a handful of ad hoc vaccine donations from the Thai government and is currently tackling significant outbreaks in five of nine camps on the border, where about 3,000 cases have been confirmed, including at least 26 deaths. A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed the government was working with the IRC on providing vaccinations in shelters along the border.
 
 Nosten's charity, Border Health Foundation (BHF), is one of eight organisations worldwide that have applied to distribute the shots from the Humanitarian Buffer and one of three to be approved, Gavi said.
 
 Ann Burton, Chief of Public Health at the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, said the liability issue was one reason agencies have been slow to apply. The programme has also been delayed by the general shortage of vaccines and administrative hurdles.
 
 Organisations applying for supplies from the buffer may not choose which vaccines they receive. Working with displaced people, Nosten said it would be more convenient to give them Johnson & Johnson's vaccine, which offers protection after a single dose instead of the two doses needed for Sinopharm's.
 
 But the Sinopharm version will be ""better than nothing,"" he said.
 
 More than 100 national governments have promised to offer vaccines where possible to all the displaced people on their soil, according to the IOM. However, the U.N. group says migrants and refugees are often effectively excluded from such schemes because of administrative or cultural hurdles.
 
 In cases where governments aren't in charge or have not agreed to vaccinate migrants, COVAX's Humanitarian Buffer is the only option. At least 40 countries have yet to include unauthorised migrants in their vaccination programmes, according to the IOM â€“ it and the UNHCR declined to name the countries.
 
 Gavi set up the buffer in March 2021, planning to reserve up to 5% of vaccine doses as they become available to COVAX, which would amount to roughly 70 million doses so far.
 
 The only shots delivered from the buffer so far - just over 1.6 million Sinopharm doses â€“ landed in Iran in November, where high numbers of displaced Afghans have arrived, UNICEF Iran said. That's enough to inoculate about 800,000 people; more will likely be needed, UNICEF said.
 
 NEED FOR SPEED
 
 The vaccine makers' legal concern is rooted in the unprecedented speed of the effort to develop the COVID shots, the EFPIA said.
 
 In normal circumstances, drugmakers buy insurance to cover liability for vaccines' potential adverse effects. But COVID forced them to develop drugs so quickly that some side effects - for instance, a rare blood-clotting condition in some of those who took the AstraZeneca vaccine - are emerging as shots go into people's arms.
 
 Many governments and international agencies have set up compensation schemes to reimburse victims and avoid lengthy litigation. An emergency law invoked by the U.S. government provides legal immunity for drug companies for side effects from their COVID-19 vaccines used in the country. The only exception is for instances of ""wilful misconduct.""
 
 For drug companies, accepting potential liability runs counter to standard practice.
 
 ""Vaccine manufacturers try to minimize legal risks in almost every setting,"" said John T. Monahan, Professor at Georgetown University. ""The gold standard is full immunity from lawsuits. If they accept carve-outs, it may become more difficult to reach that goal.""

Pushkala Aripaka    Reuters  AstraZeneca NASDAQ  and Regeneron on Thursday reported contrasting data on the effectiveness of their COVID19 antibody therapies against the Omicron variant of the coronavirus underscoring the major challenges ahead for drugmakers    USbased Regeneron said its REGENCOV therapy also called Ronapreve is less effective against Omicron though it is still active against the Delta variant confirming indications from lab tests and computer modelling late last month    AngloSwedish rival AstraZeneca however said a lab study found that its antibody cocktail Evusheld retained neutralising activity against Omicron the first such data for the treatment    The new variant has been detected in 77 countries since it was first identified three weeks ago fuelling concerns that its large number of mutations will help it spread faster and evade protection provided by COVID19 vaccines and therapeutics    Earlier this week German researchers found that COVID19 therapies developed by Eli Lilly NYSE  and Regeneron lose most of their effectiveness when exposed in laboratory tests to Omicron    But lab studies this week showed GSKVir's antibody treatment retains neutralizing activity against all tested coronavirus variants including Omicron    The study on Evusheld was done by independent investigators of the US Food and Drug Administration using socalled pseudoviruses that feature major coronavirus mutations across suspicious variants that have emerged so far    ROAD AHEAD    The researchers found the potency of Evusheld was within the ranges seen in those previously infected with COVID19 showing promise for wide use of the therapy which is the first preventative shot other than vaccines against the coronavirus    AstraZeneca said more analyses of Evusheld against Omicron are being conducted by the company and third parties with data expected very soon    Regeneron said REGENCOV is still active against Delta which currently is the most prevalent variant in the United States    The European Union's public health body however warned on Wednesday that there was a very high risk Omicron would become dominant in Europe by early next year    REGENCOV is currently authorized for use in the United States to treat people with mildtomoderate COVID19 and for prevention of infection in those exposed to infected individuals and others at high risk of exposure    Evusheld has been granted authorisation to prevent COVID19 infections in individuals with weak immune systems or a history of severe sideeffects from coronavirus vaccines    Both treatments belong to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies which mimic natural antibodies in fighting off infections    Unlike vaccines they do not rely on the body to create an immune response and can therefore help individuals with weak or compromised immune systems 55 Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A woman undergoes a health screening before receiving a dose of a vaccine

Reuters  Tens of millions of migrants may be denied COVID19 vaccines from a global programme because some major manufacturers are worried about legal risks from harmful side effects according to officials and internal documents from Gavi the charity operating the programme reviewed by Reuters    Nearly two years into a pandemic that has already killed more than 5 million people only about 7 of people in lowincome countries have received a dose Vaccine deliveries worldwide have been delayed by production problems hoarding by rich countries export restrictions and red tape Many programmes have also been hampered by hesitancy among the public    The legal concerns are an additional hurdle for public health officials tackling the coronavirus â even as officials say unvaccinated people offer an ideal environment for it to mutate into new variants that threaten hardwon immunity around the world Many COVID19 vaccine manufacturers have required that countries indemnify them for any adverse events suffered by individuals as a result of the vaccines the United Nations says    Where governments are not in control that is not possible    The concerns affect people such as those displaced by the Myanmar Afghanistan and Ethiopian crises who are beyond the reach of national governments' vaccination schemes    For refugees migrants and asylumseekers as well as people afflicted by natural disasters or other events that put them out of reach of government help the global programme known as COVAX created a Humanitarian Buffer â a lastresort reserve of shots to be administered by humanitarian groups Gavi the vaccine alliance is a publicprivate partnership set up in 2000 to promote vaccination around the world    But that buffer does not have any mechanism to offer compensation Gavi which operates COVAX with the World Health Organization WHO says that where those applying for doses mainly NGOs can't bear legal risks deliveries from that stockpile can only be made if vaccinemakers accept liability    The companies that are willing to do so under these circumstances provide only a minority of the programme's vaccines according to people familiar with the matter and the documents written by Gavi staff for a board meeting starting at the end of November    More than twothirds of COVAX doses have come from Pfizer Inc NYSE  and its partner BioNTech SE AstraZeneca NASDAQ  PLC and Moderna NASDAQ  Inc Gavi says Moderna declined to comment AstraZeneca and Pfizer said they were in talks with Gavi but declined to comment further All three said they are committed to making doses available to poorer nations at relatively low prices Pfizer said it was collaborating directly with governments in Jordan and Lebanon to donate doses for refugees    Mainly because of the legal concerns less than 2 million doses have so far been sent from the buffer Gavi says About 167 million people risk being excluded from national programmes according to United Nations data cited in the documents    Unless all the firms accept legal liability access to vaccines for some populations will remain a challenge the Gavi documents say adding that new crises will generate additional demand to cover displaced populations    The vaccine makers' reluctance to take on the legal risks is a major hurdle in attempts to provide vaccines for the buffer a spokesperson for Gavi told Reuters Gavi did not comment on the details in the documents but said applications for vaccines are confidential until the doses are delivered In September Gavi's CEO Seth Berkley tweeted an appeal to drugmakers to waive their requirements for legal indemnity    Three Chinese drugmakers have agreed to shoulder legal risks when their shots are delivered through the buffer SinoVac Biotech Ltd Sinopharm Group Co Ltd and Clover Biopharmaceuticals Co Ltd according to the Gavi document The drugmakers did not respond to requests for comment    Johnson  Johnson NYSE  of the United States confirmed it would waive a requirement for indemnity for deliveries from the buffer We are proud to be part of this effort to protect the world's most vulnerable people said Paul Stoffels Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and Chief Scientific Officer He did not elaborate    However less than onethird of COVAX supplies have come from these four firms COVAX data shows Clover's shot has not yet been approved so is not in use    The global industry association the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations IFPMA said no company has refused to consider taking on the legal risk However in the case of shots delivered from the buffer it said some firms felt they could not do so without full knowledge of where and how vaccines would be used    It would be hard to continuously monitor vaccines for safety in refugee camps and delivery is logistically very challenging and not suitable for all types said the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations EFPIA which represents large pharmaceutical companies in Europe    People may blame vaccines for problems that emerge afterwards even if they are unrelated it said    This could then lead to an increased number of litigation cases  during which the safety and efficacy of the vaccine would be publicly questioned it said in a statement to Reuters That might lead to increased vaccine hesitancy and a slower recovery from the pandemic it said    So far there is scant information on COVID vaccine litigation but claims made to outofcourt compensation programmes are one measure of the risk A programme in the United States has so far not paid out anything public data show neither has one set up by the WHO for lower income countries the WHO said In Europe a handful of compensation awards have been granted for undisclosed amounts of money official data from Denmark Germany Norway and Switzerland show    Globally there have been few reported COVID infections among refugees migrants and asylumseekers â testing is not always systematic and infections can generate only mild symptoms especially in younger people    But cramped conditions and weak healthcare expose them to high infection risk This combined with low levels of vaccination in a mobile population could favour the emergence of new variants and be a vector for infection said Mireille Lembwadio Global Vaccination Coordinator at the International Organization of Migration IOM a UNrelated body that advises governments and migrants    Leaving them unvaccinated could help spread the virus and its variants across the world she said    WAITING FOR DOSES    Francois Nosten a French professor who helps coordinate healthcare for people from Myanmar living on the border with Thailand is one of those waiting for vaccines In June he put in a request from the Humanitarian Buffer for 70000 doses â some for some of the 90000 or so who are sheltering in camps along the border but most for unregistered migrants in the border town of Mae Sot and nearby villages    Nosten whose main work is researching malaria is expecting the doses  a fraction of the more than 8 billion administered worldwide  this month He has been told they will come from Sinopharm and he hopes they can help inoculate key atrisk groups in Thailand's Tak province Gavi said delivery arrangements are still being finalised    About 20000 doses will be given to people in the camps by the International Rescue Committee IRC a humanitarian group working with Nosten    At this point whatever vaccine we can secure we are grateful for said its Thailand Director Darren Hertz He added that the IRC believed the likelihood that a member of the refugee population would attempt to take legal action in case of sideeffects was extremely low    Hertz said the IRC has received a handful of ad hoc vaccine donations from the Thai government and is currently tackling significant outbreaks in five of nine camps on the border where about 3000 cases have been confirmed including at least 26 deaths A Thai foreign ministry spokesperson confirmed the government was working with the IRC on providing vaccinations in shelters along the border    Nosten's charity Border Health Foundation BHF is one of eight organisations worldwide that have applied to distribute the shots from the Humanitarian Buffer and one of three to be approved Gavi said    Ann Burton Chief of Public Health at the UN refugee agency UNHCR said the liability issue was one reason agencies have been slow to apply The programme has also been delayed by the general shortage of vaccines and administrative hurdles    Organisations applying for supplies from the buffer may not choose which vaccines they receive Working with displaced people Nosten said it would be more convenient to give them Johnson  Johnson's vaccine which offers protection after a single dose instead of the two doses needed for Sinopharm's    But the Sinopharm version will be better than nothing he said    More than 100 national governments have promised to offer vaccines where possible to all the displaced people on their soil according to the IOM However the UN group says migrants and refugees are often effectively excluded from such schemes because of administrative or cultural hurdles    In cases where governments aren't in charge or have not agreed to vaccinate migrants COVAX's Humanitarian Buffer is the only option At least 40 countries have yet to include unauthorised migrants in their vaccination programmes according to the IOM â it and the UNHCR declined to name the countries    Gavi set up the buffer in March 2021 planning to reserve up to 5 of vaccine doses as they become available to COVAX which would amount to roughly 70 million doses so far    The only shots delivered from the buffer so far  just over 16 million Sinopharm doses â landed in Iran in November where high numbers of displaced Afghans have arrived UNICEF Iran said That's enough to inoculate about 800000 people more will likely be needed UNICEF said    NEED FOR SPEED    The vaccine makers' legal concern is rooted in the unprecedented speed of the effort to develop the COVID shots the EFPIA said    In normal circumstances drugmakers buy insurance to cover liability for vaccines' potential adverse effects But COVID forced them to develop drugs so quickly that some side effects  for instance a rare bloodclotting condition in some of those who took the AstraZeneca vaccine  are emerging as shots go into people's arms    Many governments and international agencies have set up compensation schemes to reimburse victims and avoid lengthy litigation An emergency law invoked by the US government provides legal immunity for drug companies for side effects from their COVID19 vaccines used in the country The only exception is for instances of wilful misconduct    For drug companies accepting potential liability runs counter to standard practice    Vaccine manufacturers try to minimize legal risks in almost every setting said John T Monahan Professor at Georgetown University The gold standard is full immunity from lawsuits If they accept

 (Reuters) - A three-dose course of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s COVID-19 vaccine is effective against the rapidly-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant, the pharmaceutical company said on Thursday, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.
 
 Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, match those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) which have also found a third dose of their shots works against Omicron.
 
 The study on AstraZeneca's vaccine, Vaxzevria, showed that after a three-dose course of the vaccine, neutralising levels against Omicron were broadly similar to those against the virus's Delta variant after two doses.
 
 The London-listed company said researchers at Oxford University who carried out the study were independent from those who worked on the vaccine with AstraZeneca.
 
 ""As we better understand Omicron, we believe we will find that T-cell response provides durable protection against severe disease and hospitalisations,"" Mene Pangalos, the head of AstraZeneca's biopharmaceuticals R&D said, referring to a critical component of the immune system that respond to fight infection.
 
 Antibody levels against Omicron after the booster shot were higher than antibodies in people who had been infected with and recovered naturally from COVID-19, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker added.
 
 Although the early data is positive for the company, AstraZeneca said on Tuesday it was working with its partner Oxford University to produce a vaccine tailored for Omicron, joining similar efforts from other vaccine-makers.
 
 The Oxford study analysed blood samples from those infected with COVID-19, those vaccinated with two doses and a booster, and those previously infected with other variants of concern. It included samples from 41 people given three doses of Vaxzevria.
 
 Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with shots and therapies, as the variant threatens to become dominant globally and has prompted renewed curbs ahead of the holidays to contain infections.
 
 Britain earlier this month backed the use of boosters after it found that a third dose significantly restored protection against mild disease caused by Omicron, in part reversing an otherwise steep drop in vaccine effectiveness.",Â Reuters    GBPUSD 190 Add toRemove from a Portfolio EURGBP 026 Add toRemove from a Portfolio BATS 079 Add toRemove from a Portfolio AZN 056 Add toRemove from a

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca Plc has agreed to develop an antibody-based therapy with Swiss biotechnology firm Neurimmune for a rare, underdiagnosed condition that can lead to heart failure in a deal valued up to $760 million, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.
 
 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s rare diseases unit Alexion (NASDAQ: ) and Neurimmune - the firm behind the discovery of Biogen (NASDAQ: )'s Alzheimer's drug aducanumab - will work on evaluating a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy.
 
 The potentially fatal condition is characterised by deposits of proteins called amyloid fibrils in the walls of the heart which causes them to become stiff and result in the organ being unable to pump and circulate blood effectively.
 
 Under the agreement, Alexion would pay Neurimmune an upfront payment of $30 million and it would be eligible for payments of up to $730 million upon completion of some targets, plus royalties on sales, AstraZeneca said in a statement.
 
 Neurimmune's candidate, NI006, belongs to a class of therapies called monoclonal antibodies which are lab-generated compounds mimicking the body's natural defences. NI006 targets the protein deposits and breaks them down.

 AstraZeneca PLC (NASDAQ: ) can get a boost from the probability that it will close out its US kidney damage lawsuit in New Jersey prior to the first bellwether case in March 2023, according to analysts at Citi.
 
 The UK pharma is one of several firms embroiled in US legal action over possible damage caused by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) heartburn drugs such as Nexium, launched by Astra in the US in 2001.
 
 The Citi analysts believe the most likely outcome is that the judge is delaying her response to the Defendant Motion for summary judgement on the grounds of pre-emption, to encourage the plaintiffs to settle.
 
 â€œAlternatively, but with a lower probability, Judge Cecchi may have delayed the start of the bellwether cases as she disagrees with the conclusions of Special Master Reisman and grants the defendant's motion to dismiss on grounds of pre-emption,"" they said.
 
 Either scenario would be materially positive to Astra's depressed share price, the US bank's analysts added, as would positive interim DESTINY-Breast06 data with Enhertu at the year-end and positive TROPION-Lung-01 data in March 2023.
 
 The Citi analysts said their 2023 and 2024 core EPS forecasts for Astra are 5% and 17% above consensus and repeated them alongside a price target of Â£130 and a 'buy' recommendation.

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) said on Thursday preliminary data from a trial it conducted on its COVID-19 shot, Vaxzevria, showed it generated a higher antibody response against the Omicron variant and others, including Beta, Delta, Alpha and Gamma, when given as a third booster dose.
 
 The increased response was seen in people who were previously vaccinated with either Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, the drugmaker said, adding that it would submit this data to regulators worldwide given the urgent need for boosters.
 
 AstraZeneca has developed the vaccine with researchers from the University of Oxford, and lab studies last month found a three-dose course of Vaxzevria was effective against the rapidly spreading new variant.
 
 The data is the first released by the company from its trials into boosters of its vaccine.
 
 The company said it adds to the growing evidence that supports a third dose of its vaccine irrespective of the primary vaccination schedule.
 
 ""These important studies show that a third dose of Vaxzevria after two initial doses of the same vaccine, or after mRNA or inactivated vaccines, strongly boosts immunity against COVID-19,"" Oxford Vaccine Group chief Andrew Pollard said in a statement.
 
 A major British trial in December found that AstraZeneca's shot increased antibodies when given as a booster after initial vaccination with its own shot or Pfizer (NYSE: )'s, which is based on mRNA technology.
 
 However, the study concluded that mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) gave the biggest boost to antibodies when given as a booster dose.",https://uk.investing.com//news/coronavirus/new-data-finds-astrazeneca-booster-generates-higher-antibodies-against-omicron-2561197,0.0,0.922,0.078,0.9531,"Â© Reuters.

 By Francesco Guarascio and Jennifer Rigby
 
 BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The relatively short shelf life of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine is complicating the rollout to the world's poorest nations, according to officials and internal World Health Organization documents reviewed by Reuters.
 
 It is the latest headache to plague the COVAX vaccine-sharing project, co-led by the WHO and aimed at getting shots to the world's neediest people.
 
 Initially, poorer countries and COVAX lagged richer countries in securing vaccine supplies, as wealthier nations used their financial might to acquire the first available doses.
 
 As vaccine production ramped up and richer states began donating excess doses, some countries - particularly in Africa â€“ are now struggling to administer the big shipments.
 
 The need to turn down vaccines with short shelf lives, along with the initial inequality, hesitancy and other barriers, has contributed to a much lower vaccination rate in Africa where only around 10% of people have been immunised, compared with more than 70% in richer nations.
 
 Many vaccines are arriving with only a few months, and sometimes weeks, before their use-by date, adding to the scramble to get shots in arms. Some countries have had to destroy expired doses, including Nigeria which dumped up to 1 million AstraZeneca vaccines in November.
 
 The problem with a short shelf life largely concerns AstraZeneca, according to COVAX data and officials.
 
 An internal WHO document reviewed by Reuters detailing vaccine stocks in several central and west African countries for the week ending Feb. 6 highlighted the problem.
 
 Most of the 19 listed African nations had expired AstraZeneca doses, compared to a handful of countries with expired doses from other manufacturers. Of the total expired doses declared by those countries in the week, about 1.3 million were AstraZeneca, 280,000 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), 15,000 Moderna (NASDAQ: ) and 13,000 Russia's Sputnik, the document shows.
 
 Many more vaccines are expected to be rejected as African nations and COVAX said that from January they would not accept vaccines with less than two-and-a-half months' shelf life.
 
 Yet Benin received 80,400 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX on Jan. 30, set to expire on Feb. 28. It also got 100,000 doses of the Sputnik Light vaccine from Russia, with the same expiry date - but outside the COVAX initiative. Vaccines from other manufacturers had a much longer shelf life, according to the document.
 
 ""Since January 2022, COVAX is shipping vaccines to countries on demand, ensuring that countries get the right volume at the right time,"" said Phiona Atuhebwe, a vaccine expert at WHO Africa.
 
 Asked about the internal document, seen by Reuters, she said: ""WHO is fully cognizant of the pressure that short shelf life doses put on delivery strategies and systems amid weak infrastructure and low demand.""
 
 Two and a half months of shelf life is the minimum duration African countries reckon they need to administer the shots.
 
 AstraZeneca, COVAX's second-biggest supplier after Pfizer (NYSE: ), said that since the start of the global rollout, more than 250 million of its shots left factories with less than two-and-a-half months before expiry.
 
 Short shelf life is not generally a problem for a wealthy country with expertise and infrastructure. But without systems in place, it can be insurmountable.
 
 A spokesperson for Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca said vaccines had to undergo scrupulous quality checks and pointed to the fact that the company was a major player in supporting vaccination drives in poorer nations. With donations from rich countries included, more AstraZeneca vaccines have been distributed by COVAX than any other shot.
 
 ""AstraZeneca has supplied 2.6 billion vaccine doses globally, approximately two thirds of which have gone to low and lower middle-income countries,"" the spokesperson said.
 
 ""Almost nine out of 10 doses released from our manufacturing sites ready for donation have a shelf life of at least two and a half months which is consistent with the rest of our supply chains,"" the spokesperson added.
 
 CLOCK TICKING
 
 The volumes of delivered vaccines vastly outnumber wasted doses, but the losses have been substantial thanks in part to the time pressures. This has led to AstraZeneca shots being turned down even before being shipped.
 
 Taking into account only donated doses, which represent nearly half the billion vaccines distributed by COVAX, about 30 million AstraZeneca shots were rejected or deferred last year by poor nations, said Gavi, the nonprofit that co-runs COVAX alongside the WHO. That amounts to a quarter of AstraZeneca's donated shots via COVAX.
 
 Many were later re-assigned to other countries, Gavi added, noting that more than 95% of them were AstraZeneca. It did not say where to.
 
 Millions of additional AstraZeneca doses shared by the EU, COVAX's biggest donor, have not been distributed yet, according to an EU internal document reviewed by Reuters.
 
 The main problem is the vaccine's shelf life of just six months from the date of bottling, the shortest among COVAX's top suppliers, several COVAX and EU officials told Reuters.
 
 In addition, the company's quality checks can themselves sometimes take months.
 
 COVAX's complex system to assign doses to countries, and donors' requests to deliver them to selected nations, often further eat into the vaccine's short life, leaving sometimes only a few weeks before they expire.
 
 Quality checks are conducted by all vaccine makers, but the time constraints are less of an issue for COVAX's other top suppliers. Johnson & Johnson's vaccines last two years when frozen, Pfizer's last nine months and Moderna's seven months, according to storage instructions approved by the WHO.
 
 Millions of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could also go wasted, some African countries warned in the WHO document, with the problem being linked usually to low vaccine uptake and insufficient cold-chain equipment to distribute these shots in remote regions.
 
 EXTENDING SHELF LIFE
 
 Gavi said it has encouraged AstraZeneca to apply to the WHO for an extension of the expiration date, but talks have not led yet to a formal application. AstraZeneca said the process is complex due to its vast global network of companies manufacturing its vaccine.
 
 One of its production partners, the Serum Institute of India, has been granted WHO approval for a nine-month shelf life, after it was initially authorised only for six. But other batches produced by AstraZeneca in the rest of the world have only six.
 
 ""We are currently in discussions with the World Health Organisation ... but this is a complex task which requires data to be collected from across our global manufacturing network,"" a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said.
 
 A WHO spokesperson did not comment on the talks.
 
 On average, African countries have used two-thirds of received doses, but that drops to 11% in Burundi and 15% in Congo, with other large countries, including Madagascar, Zambia, Somalia and Uganda, having used only about one-third, Gavi said, citing figures from late January.
 
 Gavi said the total wastage rate was around 0.3% of doses delivered by mid-December. It declined to share more updated figures, but said the rate was expected to rise.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/exclusiveshort-astrazeneca-shelf-life-complicates-covid-vaccine-rollout-to-worlds-poorest-2586209,0.065,0.888,0.046,-0.9601,"2/2 Â© Reuters.

 BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The relatively short shelf life of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) Plc's COVID-19 vaccine is complicating the rollout to the world's poorest nations, according to officials and internal World Health Organization documents reviewed by Reuters.
 
 It is the latest headache to plague the COVAX vaccine-sharing project, co-led by the WHO and aimed at getting shots to the world's neediest people.
 
 Initially, poorer countries and COVAX lagged richer countries in securing vaccine supplies, as wealthier nations used their financial might to acquire the first available doses.
 
 As vaccine production ramped up and richer states began donating excess doses, some countries - particularly in Africa â€“ are now struggling to administer the big shipments.
 
 The need to turn down vaccines with short shelf lives, along with the initial inequality, hesitancy and other barriers, has contributed to a much lower vaccination rate in Africa where only around 10% of people have been immunised, compared with more than 70% in richer nations.
 
 Many vaccines are arriving with only a few months, and sometimes weeks, before their use-by date, adding to the scramble to get shots in arms. Some countries have had to destroy expired doses, including Nigeria which dumped up to 1 million AstraZeneca vaccines in November.
 
 The problem with a short shelf life largely concerns AstraZeneca, according to COVAX data and officials.
 
 An internal WHO document reviewed by Reuters detailing vaccine stocks in several central and west African countries for the week ending Feb. 6 highlighted the problem.
 
 Most of the 19 listed African nations had expired AstraZeneca doses, compared to a handful of countries with expired doses from other manufacturers. Of the total expired doses declared by those countries in the week, about 1.3 million were AstraZeneca, 280,000 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ), 15,000 Moderna (NASDAQ: ) and 13,000 Russia's Sputnik, the document shows.
 
 Many more vaccines are expected to be rejected as African nations and COVAX said that from January they would not accept vaccines with less than two-and-a-half months' shelf life.
 
 Yet Benin received 80,400 AstraZeneca doses from COVAX on Jan. 30, set to expire on Feb. 28. It also got 100,000 doses of the Sputnik Light vaccine from Russia, with the same expiry date - but outside the COVAX initiative. Vaccines from other manufacturers had a much longer shelf life, according to the document.
 
 ""Since January 2022, COVAX is shipping vaccines to countries on demand, ensuring that countries get the right volume at the right time,"" said Phiona Atuhebwe, a vaccine expert at WHO Africa.
 
 Asked about the internal document, seen by Reuters, she said: ""WHO is fully cognizant of the pressure that short shelf life doses put on delivery strategies and systems amid weak infrastructure and low demand.""
 
 Two and a half months of shelf life is the minimum duration African countries reckon they need to administer the shots.
 
 AstraZeneca, COVAX's second-biggest supplier after Pfizer (NYSE: ), said that since the start of the global rollout, more than 250 million of its shots left factories with less than two-and-a-half months before expiry.
 
 Short shelf life is not generally a problem for a wealthy country with expertise and infrastructure. But without systems in place, it can be insurmountable.
 
 A spokesperson for Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca said vaccines had to undergo scrupulous quality checks and pointed to the fact that the company was a major player in supporting vaccination drives in poorer nations. With donations from rich countries included, more AstraZeneca vaccines have been distributed by COVAX than any other shot.
 
 ""AstraZeneca has supplied 2.6 billion vaccine doses globally, approximately two thirds of which have gone to low and lower middle-income countries,"" the spokesperson said.
 
 ""Almost nine out of 10 doses released from our manufacturing sites ready for donation have a shelf life of at least two and a half months which is consistent with the rest of our supply chains,"" the spokesperson added.
 
 CLOCK TICKING
 
 The volumes of delivered vaccines vastly outnumber wasted doses, but the losses have been substantial thanks in part to the time pressures. This has led to AstraZeneca shots being turned down even before being shipped.
 
 Taking into account only donated doses, which represent nearly half the billion vaccines distributed by COVAX, about 30 million AstraZeneca shots were rejected or deferred last year by poor nations, said Gavi, the nonprofit that co-runs COVAX alongside the WHO. That amounts to a quarter of AstraZeneca's donated shots via COVAX.
 
 Many were later re-assigned to other countries, Gavi added, noting that more than 95% of them were AstraZeneca. It did not say where to.
 
 Millions of additional AstraZeneca doses shared by the EU, COVAX's biggest donor, have not been distributed yet, according to an EU internal document reviewed by Reuters.
 
 The main problem is the vaccine's shelf life of just six months from the date of bottling, the shortest among COVAX's top suppliers, several COVAX and EU officials told Reuters.
 
 In addition, the company's quality checks can themselves sometimes take months.
 
 COVAX's complex system to assign doses to countries, and donors' requests to deliver them to selected nations, often further eat into the vaccine's short life, leaving sometimes only a few weeks before they expire.
 
 Quality checks are conducted by all vaccine makers, but the time constraints are less of an issue for COVAX's other top suppliers. Johnson & Johnson's vaccines last two years when frozen, Pfizer's last nine months and Moderna's seven months, according to storage instructions approved by the WHO.
 
 Millions of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines could also go wasted, some African countries warned in the WHO document, with the problem being linked usually to low vaccine uptake and insufficient cold-chain equipment to distribute these shots in remote regions.
 
 EXTENDING SHELF LIFE
 
 Gavi said it has encouraged AstraZeneca to apply to the WHO for an extension of the expiration date, but talks have not led yet to a formal application. AstraZeneca said the process is complex due to its vast global network of companies manufacturing its vaccine.
 
 One of its production partners, the Serum Institute of India, has been granted WHO approval for a nine-month shelf life, after it was initially authorised only for six. But other batches produced by AstraZeneca in the rest of the world have only six.
 
 ""We are currently in discussions with the World Health Organisation ... but this is a complex task which requires data to be collected from across our global manufacturing network,"" a spokesperson for AstraZeneca said.
 
 A WHO spokesperson did not comment on the talks.
 
 On average, African countries have used two-thirds of received doses, but that drops to 11% in Burundi and 15% in Congo, with other large countries, including Madagascar, Zambia, Somalia and Uganda, having used only about one-third, Gavi said, citing figures from late January.
 
 Gavi said the total wastage rate was around 0.3% of doses delivered by mid-December. It declined to share more updated figures, but said the rate was expected to rise.",22 Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A healthcare professional prepares a dose of AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccine at the Narok County

 (Reuters) - A large study into rare blood clots linked with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s COVID-19 vaccine found between just one and three cases per million, and only after the first dose, shedding fresh light on the side-effects from the shot.
 
 Researchers have sought to analyse any link between COVID-19 vaccines and rare blood clots in the brain, arteries or veins - sometimes accompanied by low platelets, reports of which led many nations last year to pause use of the AstraZeneca shot, which was developed with Oxford University.
 
 A study published in the PLOS Medicine journal on Tuesday looked at health records of 46 million adults in England between December 2020 and March 2021 to assess the risk of clots in the month after vaccination with either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or AstraZeneca-Oxford shot, compared with the unvaccinated.
 
 It was carried out by William Whiteley of the University of Edinburgh and Britain's BHF Data Science Centre.
 
 It found no risk of major arterial and venous thrombotic events in those aged 70 or over with either of the vaccines.
 
 And while the risk of intracranial venous thrombosis (ICVT) following the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine was nearly double in those under 70, that was equal to between just one and three cases per million.
 
 The risks of ICVT and hospitalisation with thrombocytopenia ""are likely to be outweighed by the vaccines' effect in reducing COVID-19 mortality and morbidity,"" the study's authors said.
 
 Cases of rare blood clotting emerged early last year as the rollout of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine began in Europe.
 
 Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: )'s COVID-19 vaccine, which is based on a similar platform to the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot, has also been associated with the rare combination of blood clotting and low platelet counts.
 
 Some countries have restricted or suspended use of the vaccines after the EU drug regulator confirmed possible links between the shots and the conditions.
 
 International drug regulators have said the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks.
 
 The study is in line with a review by the EU drug regulator which said last month there were fewer such side effects observed after the second AstraZeneca dose.
 
 AstraZeneca said in a statement the study confirmed what is already known about ""extremely rare blood disorders following vaccination.""
 
 ""The risk of developing this very rare condition remains substantially higher after COVID-19,"" it added.
 
 Last year, a study led and funded by AstraZeneca found its vaccine carried a small additional risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after the first dose but none after the second.
 
 AstraZeneca-Oxford's ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 shot, sold under the brands Vaxzevria and Covishield with more than 2.6 billion doses supplied globally as of February, remains a key weapon against the pandemic in middle-income countries.
 
 A second peer-reviewed British study also released on Tuesday found the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in the four weeks after receiving the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot was roughly twice as high as before vaccination, but it still implied only one in four million people could have the side-effect.
 
 The study assessed data for more than 11 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, spanning nearly seven months from December 2020 to June 2021.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/very-small-blood-clot-risk-after-first-astrazeneca-covid-shot--uk-studies-2590095,0.045,0.949,0.006,-0.9246,"Â© Reuters.

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca non-executive Chairman Leif Johansson will retire next year after serving 11 years in the role, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said on Tuesday, as it moves onto the next stage of growth led by newer therapies, including for cancer.
 
 The Swedish businessman, 70, became chairman in 2012, around the same time Frenchman Pascal Soriot took charge as chief executive. Soriot in an interview with the Financial Times https://on.ft.com/3zapoJp last May hinted that succession planning had begun for him and Johansson.
 
 The London-listed drugmaker said on Tuesday that Johansson would step down following the annual general meeting in 2023 and the search for a chair successor was ""proceeding well.""
 
 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) last year asked Johansson to continue in his role to oversee its now-completed $39 billion acquisition of rare diseases drug maker Alexion (NASDAQ: ), its biggest deal on record, while it also navigated developments around its COVID-19 shot.
 
 He also served as chairman of telecommunications firm Ericsson (BS: ) from 2011 until 2018.
 
 New governance codes introduced in 2019 to diversify talent said that a chair for a firm in Britain should not remain in the post beyond nine years, and companies must carefully consider any extension beyond that for a limited period.
 
 AstraZeneca said on Tuesday it had once again asked Johansson, who reached nine years' tenure in 2021, to continue for another year until 2023 to facilitate the succession planning.
 
 ""The Board believes it would be in the best interests of shareholders for Mr Johansson to seek re-election at the AGM in April 2022 and continue to serve as Chair for one further year,"" it said in a statement.
 
 Following confirmation of Johansson's retirement plans, Soriot's tenure could come back into investor focus as it leaves behind only him from the old guard at the top. Former finance chief Marc Dunoyer was moved to a new role to lead Alexion.",Â Reuters FILE PHOTO A vial labelled AstraZeneca COVID19 Vaccine is seen in this illustration taken January 16 2022

AstraZeneca shot which was developed with Oxford University    A study published in the PLOS Medicine journal on Tuesday looked at health records of 46 million adults in England between December 2020 and March 2021 to assess the risk of clots in the month after vaccination with either the PfizerBioNTech vaccine or AstraZenecaOxford shot compared with the unvaccinated    It was carried out by William Whiteley of the University of Edinburgh and Britain's BHF Data Science Centre    It found no risk of major arterial and venous thrombotic events in those aged 70 or over with either of the vaccines    And while the risk of intracranial venous thrombosis ICVT following the AstraZenecaOxford vaccine was nearly double in those under 70 that was equal to between just one and three cases per million    The risks of ICVT and hospitalisation with thrombocytopenia are likely to be outweighed by the vaccines' effect in reducing COVID19 mortality and morbidity the study's authors said    Cases of rare blood clotting emerged early last year as the rollout of the AstraZenecaOxford vaccine began in Europe    Johnson  Johnson NYSE 's COVID19 vaccine which is based on a similar platform to the AstraZenecaOxford shot has also been associated with the rare combination of blood clotting and low platelet counts    Some countries have restricted or suspended use of the vaccines after the EU drug regulator confirmed possible links between the shots and the conditions    International drug regulators have said the benefits of vaccines outweigh the risks    The study is in line with a review by the EU drug regulator which said last month there were fewer such side effects observed after the second AstraZeneca dose    AstraZeneca said in a statement the study confirmed what is already known about extremely rare blood disorders following vaccination    The risk of developing this very rare condition remains substantially higher after COVID19 it added    Last year a study led and funded by AstraZeneca found its vaccine carried a small additional risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after the first dose but none after the second    AstraZenecaOxford's ChAdOx1 nCoV19 shot sold under the brands Vaxzevria and Covishield with more than 26 billion doses supplied globally as of February remains a key weapon against the pandemic in middleincome countries    A second peerreviewed British study also released on Tuesday found the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis CVST in the four weeks after receiving the AstraZenecaOxford shot was roughly twice as high as before vaccination but it still implied only one in four million people could have the sideeffect    The study assessed data for more than 11 million people in England Scotland and Wales spanning

 The FDA authorized an increased dose in the case of AstraZeneca Plc's ( : NASDAQ: ) pre-exposure prophylaxis drug Evusheld (tixagevimab and cilgavimab).
 
 ""Based on the most recent information and data available, Evusheld may be less active against certain Omicron subvariants.

 Omicron subvariant BA.2 is 16-fold less susceptible to sotrovimab than against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus. The agency added that it is unknown whether the reduced potency will impact its effectiveness.
 
 In addition, the updated document adds the vague language that sotrovimab is not authorized as a COVID-19 treatment in geographic regions where the infection is likely to have been caused by a non-susceptible SARS-Cov-2 variant.

 AstraZeneca PLC (LON: ) announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the company's Imjudo (tremelimumab) drug in combination with Imfinzi (durvalumab) for treatment of adult patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer.
 
 The approval is based on results from the HIMALAYA Phase III trial, which showed that a single priming dose of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody Imjudo added to the anti-PD-L1 antibody Imfinzi reduced the risk of death by 22% compared with sorafenib, the pharmaceuticals company said.
 
 Liver cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer death and the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. It is the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with approximately 36,000 new diagnoses each year, the 100-listed company said.
 
 In a statement, Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology business unit at AstraZeneca, commented: ""With this first regulatory approval for Imjudo, patients with unresectable liver cancer in the US now have an approved dual immunotherapy treatment regimen that harnesses the potential of CTLA-4 inhibition in a unique combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor to enhance the immune response against their cancer.""
 
 Dr Ghassan Abou-Alfa, attending physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), and principal investigator in the HIMALAYA Phase III trial, said: ""Patients with unresectable liver cancer are in need of well-tolerated treatments that can meaningfully extend overall survival. In addition to this regimen demonstrating a favourable three-year survival rate in the HIMALAYA trial, safety data showed no increase in severe liver toxicity or bleeding risk for the combination, important factors for patients with liver cancer who also have advanced liver disease.""
 
 Regulatory applications for Imjudo in combination with Imfinzi are currently under review in Europe, Japan and several other countries for the treatment of patients with advanced liver cancer based on the HIMALAYA results, AstraZeneca said.

 The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted full Marketing Authorisation to AstraZeneca Plc's AZN COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S [Recombinant]).
 
 COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria (ChAdOx1-S [Recombinant]). Vaxzevria was initially granted a conditional Marketing Authorisation due to the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic. As there continues to be sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy confirming the benefits of Vaxzevria, the EMA has now granted full approval.
 
 The approval covers the use of Vaxzevria in both a primary vaccination series and as both a heterologous (with an approved mRNA COVID-19 vaccine) or homologous (all the same vaccine) third-dose booster.

 AstraZeneca-Oxford University Partnered Nasal COVID-19 Vaccine Flunks Human Trial. Vaxzevria has been demonstrated to be effective against all forms of COVID-19, from mild symptomatic to severe disease, including hospitalization and death, according to clinical studies and real-world evidence.
 
 These include an expert review of data from 52 real-world studies that showed that Vaxzevria and the available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines provide equally effective protection against hospitalization and death from COVID-19 following three doses.
 
 There is also a substantial body of evidence supporting boosting with Vaxzevria following all primary vaccination schedules tested to date.
 
 Price Action: AZN shares are up 1.82% at $59.88 during the premarket session on the last check Tuesday.

 AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) stated that Beyfortus was now the first and only single-dose RSV passive immunisation for the broad infant population, including those born healthy, at term or pre-term, or with specific health conditions.
 
 The 100-listed group said the European Commission was the first regulatory body to grant approval to Beyfortus, with the approval based on results from the drug's clinical development programme and follows a recommendation from The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency in September.
 
 In AZN's ""pivotal"" MELODY efficacy trial, Beyfortus met its primary endpoint of reducing the incidence of medically attended lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV by 74.5% versus placebo through day 151 with a single dose.
 
 Iskra Eric, AZN's executive vice president of vaccines and immune therapies, said: ""Beyfortus is the first single-dose preventative option against respiratory syncytial virus to gain approval in Europe and is also the first and only preventative option approved for a broad infant population.
 
 ""Today's marketing authorisation of Beyfortus marks a significant achievement for the scientific community and addresses a persistent, global unmet need in RSV prevention.""

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine still has a role to play in the fight against the pandemic, even as sales slow and the company charges more in some places, CEO Pascal Soriot said on Friday, the latest drugmaker to warn about a global supply glut.
 
 The comments come after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter profit and sales driven by the vaccine, its second bestseller last year raking in $3.9 billion. It also confirmed its forecast that 2022 sales of the shot would fall.
 
 The vaccine, branded as Vaxzevria and Covishield, has struggled to compete with rivals made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: ) using mRNA technology, and has hit setbacks with production, rare side-effects and relatively limited shelf life. Approval in the United States has been delayed.
 
 Soriot said the shot, which was seen early in the pandemic as the inoculation of choice for low-income countries, should remain relevant because it's easy to administer and distribute.
 
 Volume will ease, though, because people will probably only need one booster.
 
 ""We are no longer in a period of scarcity of vaccine supply - we have oversupply everywhere around the world. So what is out there needs to be used and then of course we'll be able to get a better sense for reordering,"" he said on a media call.
 
 Rival Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) this month pulled its sales forecast for its COVID-19 vaccine, blaming oversupply on hesitancy in developing countries.
 
 So far, 2.9 billion shots of the AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) vaccine have been delivered globally.
 
 In the first quarter, the company recorded $1.15 billion in sales for the product, the majority of which came from initial contracts, but that number eclipsed analysts' consensus forecast of $739 million, cited by Credit Suisse (SIX: ).
 
 AstraZeneca's shares were down 0.6% in early afternoon trading, underperfoming London's blue-chip index.
 
 The company has started earning a modest profit on the vaccine, which was initially sold at-cost, but it will continue selling in low-income countries on a non-profit basis.
 
 Apart from the vaccine, AstraZeneca also has a COVID-19 treatment, Evusheld, which has been authorised in many regions including the United States, United Kingdom and European Union for preventing infections in people whose immune system is too weak to respond to vaccines.
 
 The drug generated $469 million in first-quarter revenue, below the consensus forecast of $480 million, cited by Credit Suisse.
 
 Access to the drug in the United States has been limited by logistical bottlenecks that are being addressed, Soriot said, adding Britain was one of the few developed countries that has not ordered Evusheld.
 
 ""It's a sad situation, quite frankly, because people who are immunocompromised are really suffering from the COVID crisis.""
 
 CANCER
 
 AstraZeneca - which unveiled plans to open an R&D centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts designed to serve as the new headquarters for rare disease unit Alexion (NASDAQ: ), which it bought last summer - relies on cancer drugs for about a third of its total product sales.
 
 Even though COVID-19 levels are beginning to wane, access to cancer diagnoses and treatment has still not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels. Things should normalise over the next few months, Soriot predicted.
 
 Meanwhile, the company pared back its expectations for China, which accounted for about 16% of total revenue last year.
 
 The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said it expected sales there to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2022, largely due to the impact of a programme designed to bring down the prices of off-patent drugs in the country.
 
 ""The future for China, we believe is still very strong and we expect to return to growth in the next couple of years,"" Soriot said, cautioning that lockdowns in China this year could hurt the

 LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and Daiichi Sankyo's Enhertu extended survival by more than six months in patients with a form of advanced breast cancer compared to standard chemotherapy, according to data presented on Sunday.
 
 The data, unveiled at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, could open a large, new multibillion-dollar patient population for the drug that won U.S. approval in late 2019 as a third-line treatment for the 15% of breast cancer patients with HER2-positive disease.
 
 The ongoing phase III trial involves over 550 patients with so-called HER2-low breast cancer - most with tumours that were hormone-sensitive - whose disease had spread and had undergone at least one round of chemotherapy.
 
 The interim analysis showed Enhertu prolonged survival by an additional 6.4 months in patients with hormone-sensitive tumours. Patients in the group lived for a median of 23.9 months versus 17.5 months for chemotherapy.
 
 In the small group of patients with hormone-insensitive tumours, patients on Enhertu lived 6.3 months longer.
 
 That the benefit in overall survival was apparent even at the point of interim analysis was surprising, David Fredrickson, executive vice president of AstraZeneca's oncology unit, told Reuters.
 
 ""That really puts a lot of confidence that the benefit that we're seeing here is absolutely real.""
 
 A host of targeted therapies has greatly improved the prognosis for patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer. But more than half of women whose breast cancer has spread to other organs and express little or no HER2 - referred to as HER2-low status - have limited treatment options.
 
 Hormone-sensitive patients who received Enhertu also went an average of 10.1 months before their disease began to worsen - a measure known as progression free survival (PFS) - compared with 5.4 months for chemotherapy, which was statistically significant.
 
 Enhertu more than doubled the PFS for hormone-insensitive patients at 6.6 months versus 2.9 months for chemotherapy.
 
 AstraZeneca is in discussions with regulators globally for approval in the HER2-low population. Jefferies analysts last month forecast $2.5 billion in annual global peak Enhertu sales for these patients, and about $6.6 billion across all indications.
 
 The drug, which is administered as an intravenous infusion, is not without safety concerns. It has been linked to a type of lung scarring called interstitial lung disease (ILD). Forty-five Enhertu patients in the trial had varying degrees of ILD versus one in the chemotherapy group.
 
 Enhertu belongs to class of therapies called antibody drug conjugates (ADC), which are engineered antibodies that bind to tumour cells and release cell-killing chemicals.
 
 Last month, it gained approval as a second-line treatment option after a study showed it reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 72% compared to Roche's Kadcyla, which has been the standard treatment.
 
 Enhertu is being evaluated for use in earlier stages of breast cancer, as well as lung and colorectal cancers, among others. It has secured approval in HER2-driven gastric cancer.
 
 ""As far as breast cancer goes, I'd say at least in the next few years, I'm pretty sure in Enhertu is going to kind of finish revolutionising the treatment paradigm,"" Tara Hansen, a consultant at Informa Pharma Custom Intelligence, told Reuters.

 (Reuters) -Britain's medicines regulator has approved AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s antibody-based COVID-19 treatment for preventing infections in adults with poor immune response, marking a major step in the fight against the pandemic as infections surge globally.
 
 The decision to grant approval for the treatment, Evusheld, was endorsed by the government's independent scientific advisory body, Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said https://www.gov.uk/government/news/evusheld-approved-to-prevent-covid-19-in-people-whose-immune-response-is-poor on Thursday.
 
 Figures showing a global rise in COVID-19 cases could herald a much bigger problem, the World Health Organization said this week, warning nations to remain vigilant.
 
 Although 85% of Britons over the age of 12 have been vaccinated with two doses, some immune compromised individuals or those with a history of severe adverse reactions to a vaccine may need an alternative prevention option.
 
 ""While the COVID-19 vaccines continue to be the first-line defence against COVID-19, we know that some people may not respond adequately to these vaccines,' MHRA chief June Raine said.
 
 Vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, but Evusheld contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
 
 The therapy was found to cut the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% in trials, with protection lasting for at least six months after a single dose, the MHRA said.
 
 Evusheld has been also shown to save lives and prevent disease progression when given within a week of first symptoms.
 
 Britain and AstraZeneca currently do not have an agreement for supply of Evusheld.
 
 AstraZeneca in a statement said it hopes to see the therapy made available to Britons ""as quickly as possible"".

 (Reuters) -Britain's medicines regulator has approved AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s antibody-based COVID-19 treatment for preventing infections in adults with poor immune response, marking a major step in the fight against the pandemic as infections surge globally.
 
 The decision to grant approval for the treatment, Evusheld, was endorsed by the government's independent scientific advisory body, Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said https://www.gov.uk/government/news/evusheld-approved-to-prevent-covid-19-in-people-whose-immune-response-is-poor on Thursday.
 
 Figures showing a global rise in COVID-19 cases could herald a much bigger problem, the World Health Organization said this week, warning nations to remain vigilant.
 
 Although 85% of Britons over the age of 12 have been vaccinated with two doses, some immune compromised individuals or those with a history of severe adverse reactions to a vaccine may need an alternative prevention option.
 
 ""While the COVID-19 vaccines continue to be the first-line defence against COVID-19, we know that some people may not respond adequately to these vaccines,' MHRA chief June Raine said.
 
 Vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, but Evusheld contains lab-made antibodies designed to linger in the body for months to contain the virus in case of an infection.
 
 The therapy was found to cut the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 by 77% in trials, with protection lasting for at least six months after a single dose, the MHRA said.
 
 Evusheld has been also shown to save lives and prevent disease progression when given within a week of first symptoms.
 
 Britain and AstraZeneca currently do not have an agreement for supply of Evusheld.
 
 AstraZeneca in a statement said it hopes to see the therapy made available to Britons ""as quickly as possible"".

 LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) moved to bolster its COVID-19 portfolio of antibodies on Tuesday with a $157 million licensing deal for experimental therapies developed by newly-launched biotech RQ Bio.
 
 In addition to the initial sum, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker faces possible royalty payments as part of the exclusive licence to develop pre-clinical COVID antibodies engineered by RQ Bio, the start-up said. AstraZeneca announced the deal but not its size.
 
 The antibodies include those designed to target people with compromised immune systems - such as AstraZeneca's own antibody cocktail, Evusheld, which has already been approved in multiple countries.
 
 The deal gives AstraZeneca the rights to develop and sell six antibodies, none of which has been tested in humans so far, RQ Bio CEO Hugo Fry said in an interview with Reuters.
 
 In lab studies, the antibodies have been shown to work against all known variants, including Omicron, he said.
 
 Access to a fresh crop of COVID antibodies will bolster AstraZeneca's COVID portfolio, which is expecting to see a rapid decline in COVID vaccine sales in 2022.
 
 The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's vaccine was its second bestseller last year, but it has struggled to compete with rivals made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: ), and has hit setbacks with production, rare side-effects and relatively limited shelf life.
 
 AstraZeneca's Evusheld - which is designed to prevent symptomatic COVID infections in people who are unable to derive maximum benefit from vaccines - is expected to partially offset waning vaccine sales.
 
 It has been possible to manufacture antibodies - proteins that latch on to thwart the body's assailants both foreign (such as viruses and bacteria) and domestic (like cancer cells) - for some time.
 
 Their use, however, has been limited to relatively niche conditions, such as patients with certain cancers, Fry said.
 
 More recently, and particularly as the COVID crisis unfolded, the scientific understanding of what antibodies can do and the ability to make them cheaply and consistently has increased.
 
 ""We're at this tipping point now...where you can use them a lot more broadly,"" said Fry.
 
 RQ Bio is hoping to capitalise on this opportunity as scientists anticipate recurrent anti-COVID shots.

 LONDON (Reuters) -The European health regulator on Thursday endorsed the use of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s COVID vaccine, Vaxzevria, as a booster.
 
 The recommendation, made by a committee of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), encompasses adults who have either been previously vaccinated by Vaxzevria or an mRNA vaccine, such as the ones made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and BioNTech or Moderna (NASDAQ: ).
 
 The recommendation comes weeks after the EMA backed the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's Comirnaty as a booster for adults who have previously been inoculated with other vaccines.
 
 Vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, have indicated that most vaccinations this year will be booster shots, or first inoculations for children, which are still gaining regulatory approvals around the world.
 
 It is unclear how many boosters will be needed globally, and many developed countries have already begun to roll them out. In some countries, even second booster campaigns for some high-risk groups have begun.
 
 Meanwhile, vaccine makers are also developing variant-specific vaccines. Earlier this month, the EMA said it hoped to have vaccines adapted to address coronavirus variants, such as Omicron, approved by September.
 
 Although Vaxzevria was AstraZeneca's second best seller last year, it has struggled to compete with mRNA rivals. In late April, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot asserted that the shot still had a role in fighting the pandemic.
 
 ""We believe this vaccine still has a potential, it's very easy to administer and distribute,"" he said. ""The volume in the future will be less because people probably will only need one booster per year and not everybody will take it.""
 
 About half of all EU citizens are fully vaccinated and boosted, while 15% of those over 18 have not received even one vaccine shot, said Marco Cavaleri, the EMA's head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, on May 5.",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/eu-health-regulator-backs-using-astrazeneca-covid-shot-as-booster-2652632,0.027,0.915,0.059,0.8947,"Â© Reuters.

 (Reuters) - Drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) said on Monday its COVID-19 vaccine, Vaxzevria, has been approved in the European Union by the bloc's drugs regulator as a third-dose booster in adults following a committee endorsement last week.
 
 The vaccine can now be used as a booster following the two-dose Vaxzevria schedule or by those who have been previously vaccinated by an mRNA vaccine, such as the ones made by Pfizer (NYSE: ) and BioNTech or Moderna (NASDAQ: ).
 
 ""Ensuring a longer duration of immune protection is essential to the long-term management of COVID-19 globally, and boosters can address the waning of protection over time that has been seen with all primary vaccine schedules to date,"" Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca, said in a .

 DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Although cancer screening and diagnosis was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, resulting advances in medical technology and greater diversity in clinical trials could help treatments in the future, an AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) executive said.
 
 Testing and diagnosis rates for cancer dropped by 15% to 25% over the past two years as people skipped routine checkups, Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president of oncology at AstraZeneca, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum in Davos.
 
 ""What that means is that we are diagnosing cancer patients late,"" Fredrickson said this week, with cancer outcomes being best when diagnosed early.
 
 Efforts to minimise patients having to go to healthcare facilities, wider adoption of telemedicine, and bringing trials to patients rather than have patients come to trials are ""particularly important,"" Fredrickson said.
 
 ""Clinical trial diversity is one of the most important steps to ... deliver cancer therapies in an equitable way across the globe,"" he said.
 
 Fredrickson said he was more optimistic on the detection and treatment of lung and breast cancer, as new drugs and treatment plans have improved survival rates in certain settings.
 
 Public-private partnerships will be important in improving cancer diagnosis and survival rates, he said, pointing to Egypt's strategy to tackle prevalent cancers and U.S. President Joe Biden's revival of the ""Cancer Moonshot"" initiative.
 
 The programme, an Obama administration initiative revived by Biden in February, aims to improve cancer detection and prevention, while encouraging cancer research.

 AZN +0.56% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio A1ZN34 -0.97% Add to/Remove from a Portfolio
 
 On Tuesday, shares of AstraZeneca PLC ( : NASDAQ: ) experienced volatile short activity. After the activity, the stock price went up 2.85% to $62.83.
 
 The overall sentiment for AZN has been Bullish.
 
 The signal from the volatility alert is trending Bullish. Therefore, the recommendation is to Strong Buy.
 
 The volatility alert was produced on the prior trading date, 6/21/2022, with a volatility change of -19.48%. The current volatility indicator stands at 9.166.
 
 Overview:
 
 The securities lending volatility indicator is produced by Tidal Markets, in partnership with Benzinga Insights. Securities lending primarily serves the purpose of providing liquidity to short sellers. When unusual activity occurs in the securities lending markets, it acts as an upstream indicator to what is likely to occur downstream in the regular stock market.
 
 Understanding the Volatility Alert:
 
 Overall sentiment is considered ""bear"" when broad market activity of the stock has been shown to indicate a negative directional basis, or is considered ""bull"" when indicating a positive directional basis. The securities lending volatility indicator provides a signal when it detects unusual short activity. Unusual short activity is based off a computer generated algorithmic formula utilizing securities lending trade details such as the volume of shares being shorted, the rate being paid to short the shares, and the type of collateral being posted - amongst other variables. The current volatility is the respective trading day's calculated securities lending volatility value. The volatility percentage change is the percentage difference in volatility between the two most recent days. The recommendation is a suggestive strategy, inferred from the strength of the Signal Trending, Current Volatility, and Volatility % Change. Recommendations may include, ""Strong Buy"", ""Strong Sell"", ""Increase Short Exposure"", ""Decrease Short Exposure"", or ""Market Neutral"".

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca said on Monday two of its existing therapies were recommended for treating patients with some forms of high-risk breast cancers in the European Union, in a boost to the company's oncology portfolio.
 
 Lynparza, a cancer drug developed jointly with U.S.-based Merck, was backed for standalone use or in combination with endocrine therapy in adults with a form of genetically mutated early-stage breast cancer.
 
 The drug, which has received a similar recommendation in the United States in March, is a key asset for AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ). It was recommended in patients with low-to-normal levels of a protein known as HER2 that is the target of several new therapies.

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) said on Thursday a combination of its cancer drug, Imfinzi, and chemotherapy showed promise in a late-stage trial in patients with an aggressive form of lung cancer, when given before surgery.
 
 Data showed the combination was more effective in removing cancer cells in tissue samples taken during surgery when compared with just chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker said.
 
 The interim result is a boost to the company's oncology efforts - a major area of focus - following disappointing data for Imfinzi earlier in the year in another area of therapy. (https://reut.rs/3nq1chi)
 
 AstraZeneca added the trial would continue as planned to assess the additional main goal of event-free survival, and the interim data would be shared with health authorities globally.
 
 Imfinzi belongs to the immunotherapy class of treatments, which boost the body's defences to fight cancer by using antibodies that block or bind to foreign substances in the body. The treatment generated $2.41 billion in 2021 sales.
 
 ""Engaging the immune response with Imfinzi both before and after surgery is an exciting new strategy,"" said Susan Galbraith, executive vice president of oncology R&D at AstraZeneca.

 Stocks
 
 Royal Dutch Shell (LON: ) - The remaining $5.5 billion of proceeds from the Permian divestment will be distributed in the form of share buybacks at pace. Q4 integrated gas production expected to be between 910 and 950 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Upstream production expected to be between 2,150 and 2,250 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day. Oil products marketing results are expected to be in line with the fourth quarter 2020 but lower compared with the third quarter 2021 due to seasonal trends, the demand impact due to the Omicron virus and foreign exchange impacts in Turkey.

Under the agreement, AstraZenecaâ€™s Alexion (NASDAQ: ) will be granted an exclusive worldwide licence to develop, manufacture and commercialise NI006.
 
 Aston Martin Lagonda (LON: ) - FY wholesales grew 82% to 6,182. 10 Aston Martin Valkyrie and Valkyrie AMR Pro vehicles were shipped in Q4. This was fewer than previously planned and accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be circa Â£15 million lower than expected. An associated reduction in 2021 depreciation and amortisation is expected to result in a broadly net neutral impact on adjusted operating profit.

 FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Long-serving AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) boss Pascal Soriot said on Friday he expects to work with the new chairman-designate of the London-listed drugmaker, who will take over in 2023, for many years to come, suggesting he is not ready to retire.
 
 The company said on Friday that Michel Demare will take over from outgoing Chairman Leif Johansson, who, like Soriot, has been in his leadership position for about a decade.
 
 ""Michel and I will be working together and forming an excellent team for the many years to come,"" Soriot said on an analyst call after the company released its quarterly results. Â© Reuters. AstraZeneca follows the trend in the sector to upgrade guidance as Covid vaccines sales show resilience

 AstraZeneca PLC (LSE:NASDAQ: ) followed its smaller rival GSK PLC (LSE:GSK, NYSE:GSK) by upgrading guidance for the full year after a bumper first half which exceeded expectations.
 
 The key driver for the outperformance appears to be sales of the groupâ€™s Covid vaccine, which was jointly developed with the University of Oxford.
 
 The drugs giant had expected revenues from the jab to decline by 20% to 25% this year, it now reckons they will be flat.
 
 As a result, the Anglo-Swedish company reckons top line growth for 2022 will be in the ""low twenties"" per cent, up from the ""high teens"".
 
 Core EPS, meanwhile, will grow in mid-to-high ""twenties"" per cent, which is unchanged from previous guidance and reflects AZâ€™s resolve to spend more on research and development than first planned.
 
 Sales of the six months ended 30 June 2022 were up 43% at US$22.16bn, with core per share earnings matching that advance to US$3.61.
 
 While the performance of the vaccines business stood out, the pharma group said the oncology franchise also performed strongly.
 
 â€œGiven the ongoing performance of our underlying business and the contribution of our COVID-19 medicines, we are updating our revenue guidance for 2022,â€ said chief executive Pascal Soriot.
 
 â€œThis has enabled us to increase our R&D investment in the exciting number of pipeline opportunities that can benefit patients and drive long-term sustainable growth for our company.â€
 
 In a separate announcement, the group said that former UBS vice chairman and current AZ independent director, Mark DemarÃ©, will succeed Leif Johansson as the chairman of the 100â€™s biggest company.

 (Reuters) -AstraZeneca said it expected prescriptions of its COVID therapy to drive sales growth of more than 20% this year, as company reported second-quarter profit that topped analyst estimates.
 
 The injection, called Evusheld, which is designed to protect against COVID infection for at least six months, has been deployed in many countries for people with compromised immune systems who see little or no benefit from vaccines.
 
 The long-acting antibody therapy, launched in December last year, generated sales of $445 million in the quarter.
 
 ""Real-world evidence has shown that 30% to 40% of COVID hospitalisations are in immunocompromised patients, so there is a real need for Evusheld right now,"" finance chief Aradhana Sarin told Reuters.
 
 The London-listed company increased its full-year revenue guidance, saying it expects it to rise by a percentage in the ""low twenties"" rather than the ""high teens"" forecast previously.
 
 It kept its forecast for a gain in adjusted earnings per share in the ""mid-to-high twenties percentage"" unchanged, partly because of a bigger budget for drug research and development and for the marketing and distribution of Evusheld.
 
 The company also felt the impact of inflation with distribution costs like freight rates up by more that 30%, CFO Sarin said in a media briefing.
 
 Analysts at brokerages Jefferies and JPMorgan (NYSE: ) said investors were unlikely to be impressed by the earnings outlook and its shares fell as much as 3.1% and were down 2% at 0930 GMT, underperforming the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index that slipped 0.3%.
 
 Second-quarter adjusted earnings almost doubled to $1.72 cents per share for the three months ended June 30, on revenue of about $10.8 billion, up 31%. Analysts on average expected profit of $1.56 cents per share on revenue of around $10.5 billion, Refinitiv data showed.
 
 On Friday, the company also said Michel DemarÃ© will take over from non-executive Chairman Leif Johansson when he retires next year. DemarÃ© currently serves as the chair of AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s remuneration committee.
 
 Johansson became chairman in 2012, around the same time as Frenchman Pascal Soriot took charge as chief executive.
 
 The move rules out Soriot, who fended off a takeover approach from Pfizer (NYSE: ) in 2014, as a chairman candidate.
 
 As past chairman of Syngenta, DemarÃ© in 2015 led the Swiss crop chemicals maker's successful defence against an unwanted takeover approach from U.S. rival Monsanto (NYSE: ), which resulted in the agreed acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina.
 
 AstraZeneca said it expects increasing sales of Evusheld to offset a decline in sales of its COVID-19 vaccine Vaxzevria, developed with Oxford University, in the face of growing competition.
 
 The company previously expected Evusheld growth would not make up for the decline in Vaxzevria sales.
 
 Sales in key market China, which accounted for close to fifth of sales last year, slipped 6% to $1.44 billion on lower prices and as COVID lockdown measures kept some patients from seeking cancer care.
 
 Astra's best-selling product Tagrisso against lung cancer had a quarterly increase in revenues of 7% to $1.4 billion, while sales of cardiovascular and diabetes treatment Farxiga jumped 51% to $1.1 billion in the quarter, both slightly ahead of market expectations.

 (Reuters) -UK's edged up on Monday as gains in drugmaker AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) and consumer stocks relieved pressure from mining and oil heavyweights after data showed China's economy unexpectedly slowed last month.
 
 The blue-chip FTSE 100 added 0.2% to hold near 10-week highs, while the midcap inched up 0.1%.
 
 Investors are awaiting the UK employment report as well as consumer prices data later this week to gauge the state of the labour market and inflation.
 
 The data could offer clues on whether the Bank of England opts for a second consecutive 50-basis-point-rate hike at its September meeting.
 
 The mood was dull in Asian and European stock markets, with investors turning to defensive sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples amid worries about the health of the world's second-largest economy.
 
 AstraZeneca gained 2.6% after the drugmaker said its cancer drug, Enhertu, developed with Japan's Daiichi Sankyo delayed the progression of a form of advanced breast cancer in previously treated patients.

 The FTSE 100 has outperformed its global peers this year due to its large exposure to commodity stocks that have surged on the back of a jump in oil and metal prices. A weakening pound has also boosted dollar earners in the index.
 
 ""Whether this trend will continue ultimately hinges on the outlook for global energy stocks relative to the broad market,"" BCA Research analysts wrote in a note.
 
 The FTSE 100 is up nearly 2% so far this year, while the MSCI world equities index has shed almost 13%.
 
 ""Our energy strategists remain bullish on oil. Their expectation that will breach $110/bbl in Q4 and average $117/bbl in 2023 suggests that an overweight on the energy sector â€“ and by extension UK equities â€“ remains appropriate.""",https://uk.investing.com//news/stock-market-news/ftse-100-inches-higher-as-astrazeneca-counters-china-worries-2720983,0.067,0.878,0.055,-0.8176,"Â© Reuters.

 Investing.com - European stock markets largely edged higher Monday, starting the new week on a cautious note as investors digested weak Chinese economic data.
 
 By 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the in Germany traded 0.1% lower, but the in France rose 0.2%, and U.K.â€™s traded 0.2% higher.
 
 Economic data released earlier Monday showed Chinaâ€™s economic growth rate unexpectedly slowing in July, prompting the countryâ€™s central bank to in a surprise move.
 
 grew 3.8% in July from a year earlier, with the growth rate below the 4.6% increase expected, while rose 2.7% from a year ago, missing forecasts for 5.0% growth and the 3.1% growth seen in June.
 
 China's economy, the worldâ€™s second largest, is struggling to shake off the June quarter's hit to growth from strict COVID restrictions.
 
 On the flip side, back in Europe, Denmarkâ€™s economy grew faster than expected in the second quarter, expanding 0.7% from the first three months of the year, after contracted 0.5% in the first quarter of 2022.
 
 The raised interest rates by a half-point in July and is expected to do the same in September, even though the risk of a Eurozone recession has reached the highest level since November 2020 as energy shortages threaten to drive already record inflation higher still.
 
 In corporate news, AstraZeneca (LON: ) (NASDAQ: ) stock rose 2.6% after the drugmaker said its cancer drug, Enhertu, delayed the progression of a form of advanced breast cancer in previously treated patients, boosting prospects of more regulatory approvals.
 
 Henkel (ETR: ) stock rose 0.4% after the German consumer-goods company said sales rose in the first half of the year but that earnings fell, hurt by increasing raw-material and logistics prices.
 
 Oil prices fell Monday, weighed by a potential increase in supply by oil giant Saudi Aramco (TADAWUL: ) as well as concerns of slowing growth in China, the world's second-largest economy.
 
 Saudi Aramco stands ready to raise crude oil output to its maximum capacity of 12 million barrels per day if requested to do so by the Saudi Arabian government, Chief Executive Amin Nasser said Sunday, as the state-owned energy firm announced one of the largest quarterly profits in history.

 Investing.com -- Sanofi SA (EPA: ) shares slid on Wednesday after the French drugmaker announced that it will halt trials of a new treatment for patients battling advanced breast cancer.
 
 In a statement, the company said it would stop global clinical development of the medicine, known as amcenestrant, after a phase 3 study showed it was not effective enough to warrant further research.
 
 All other studies of amcenestrant, including in early-stage breast cancer, will also be discontinued, Sanofi added.

 In a note, analysts at Morgan Stanley called the decision a ""setback for the innovation narrative"" put forward by Sanofi, saying that amcenestrant had been flagged as a potentially lucrative piece in the group's drug pipeline.
 
 The end of Sanofi's amcenestrant trials is expected to lead to a 6% negative impact on the company's estimated discounted cash flow, according to the Morgan Stanley analysts.

 LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) may not stay in the vaccine business in the long run, its CEO told Reuters on Tuesday, showing how quickly fortunes have changed for the drugmaker that produced one of the first COVID-19 shots but has since lost out to rivals. Production delays, probes by regulators following rare cases of severe side effects, and concerns about its relatively short shelf life compared with other shots have stymied adoption of the company's COVID-19 vaccine.
 
 Now, in the third year of the pandemic amid a global vaccine supply glut, its use has diminished in much of the developed world as countries have inoculated large numbers of people and prefer Pfizer (NYSE: ) and Moderna (NASDAQ: )'s mRNA vaccines as boosters.
 
 AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine has still not won U.S. approval.
 
 The London-listed company is building on its portfolio of antibody therapies, including for COVID-19, the respiratory virus RSV and other viruses, Soriot said in a Reuters Newsmaker interview on Tuesday.
 
 But on the future of its COVID vaccines business, he said: ""I can't be sure we will be there or not.""
 
 He also said he wasn't sure if AstraZeneca would broaden its roster of vaccines for other infections either, adding that the company was looking into it.
 
 Investors have speculated about the future of the vaccine business given slowing sales of the COVID shot as initial sales contracts have been fulfilled, stiff competition from mRNA vaccines and its relatively little expertise in the field.
 
 The company created a separate division for vaccines and antibody therapies late last year.
 
 Still, Soriot said he did not regret the company's work with Oxford University to develop a COVID vaccine, given they had delivered billions of doses and saved an estimated 6 million lives across the globe.
 
 The inoculation was AstraZeneca's second best-selling product in 2021 with sales of $3.9 billion.
 
 AstraZeneca is also looking for bolt-on acquisitions, including small and mid-sized companies specialising in oncology and cardiovascular treatments, Soriot added.
 
 ""We always look for external opportunities,"" he said.
 
 KEEP ON DOING THIS JOB
 
 The CEO has presided over a quadrupling of AstraZeneca's share price in his decade at the helm.
 
 ""I can keep doing this job for many years,"" he said.
 
 The 63-year old was once seen as a natural successor to outgoing Chairman Leif Johansson.
 
 But in July, Soriot quashed speculation he was planning to retire any time soon, saying he expected to work with the company's newly announced chairman-designate Michel Demare for many years to come.
 
 Soriot was tasked with turning around a troubled AstraZeneca - hit by a string of key patent losses and a spate of clinical trial failures - in October 2012, following a stint at pharma peer Roche.
 
 With the Frenchman at the helm, the fortunes of the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker changed dramatically.
 
 He sharpened focus on speciality medicines and the lucrative field of oncology, made acquisitions to refill the company's medicine cabinet, fended off a hostile takeover from U.S. pharma giant Pfizer, and invested heavily in R&D to improve the company's lacklustre drug development success rate.
 
 However, he warned on Tuesday that fewer new medicines would be developed going forward due to U.S. drug price laws passed last week.
 
 Asked about inflationary pressures, Soriot said: ""We are going to have to become more innovative and productive. We can't expect our selling prices to go up.""
 
 Sales in China, which account for close to a fifth of the company's total annual revenue, have dipped in recent quarters due to lower drug prices and as COVID lockdown measures kept some patients from being diagnosed and seeking cancer care.
 
 On Tuesday, Soriot said sales were picking up in the third quarter in the world's second-largest market for pharmaceuticals - and he expected the country to play a more significant role in the global market over the next decade.

 LONDON (Reuters) -Europe's medicines regulator has backed using AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )'s preventative COVID-19 therapy as a treatment for the disease and also endorsed another medicine as preventative option for another common virus.
 
 The regulator's recommendations are usually followed by the European Commission when it takes a final decision on drug approvals.
 
 AstraZeneca said on Friday the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had backed Evusheld as a treatment for adults and adolescents with COVID who do not need supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease worsening.
 
 Last month, Japan became the first country to approve the long-acting antibody as a treatment for COVID - making Evusheld the first such therapy authorised for both prevention and treatment of the viral disease.
 
 Evusheld had previously had largely secured global approvals, including in Europe, as a preventative therapy for people with compromised immune systems who see little or no benefit from COVID vaccines.
 
 AstraZeneca is leaning on Evusheld to help offset tepid sales of its COVID vaccine that has rapidly lost ground to mRNA shots in the fight against the rapidly evolving virus.
 
 Evusheld, first launched in December, generated $914 million in the first half of 2022 for the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker.
 
 Separately on Friday, the EMA also endorsed AstraZeneca and partner Sanofi (EPA: )'s experimental long-acting therapy Beyfortus for the prevention of lower respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
 
 RSV causes thousands of hospitalisations and deaths globally each year in toddlers and the elderly, but the complex molecular structure of the virus and safety concerns have stymied efforts to develop a vaccine since the virus was first discovered in 1956.

 has said its long-acting antibody combination Evusheld (tixagevimab and cilgavimab, formerly AZD7442) has been approved in the EU for the treatment of COVID-19.
 
 The approval by the European Commission covers people over the age of 12 years who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVIDâ€‘19, the pharmaceuticals group said.
 
 The European Commissionâ€™s approval was based on results from the TACKLE phase III treatment trial which showed that Evusheld significantly reduced the risk of severe COVID-19 or death.
 
 The recommended dose of Evusheld for treatment in Europe is 300mg of tixagevimab and 300mg of cilgavimab, administered as two separate, sequential IM injections, AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: ) noted.
 
 ""Many people, including those who are immunocompromised, older adults and those with underlying health conditions, are at high risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death if they become infected. Evusheld, delivered in a convenient intramuscular formulation, is now a much-needed new COVID-19 treatment option for these vulnerable populations,"" commented Dr Michel Goldman, professor at the Institute for Interdisciplinary Innovation in Healthcare, UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles, and former executive director of the European Innovative Medicines Initiative in a statement.
 
 Iskra Reic, executive vice president of vaccines and immune therapies at AstraZeneca, added: ""COVID-19 remains an ongoing health concern for millions of Europeans and around the world, especially for those who may not be well-protected against the virus from vaccination. With this approval, Evusheld is now the only long-acting antibody combination available for both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in Europe, allowing us to protect even more people from this devastating disease.""

 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (L: ) has resumed the U.S. trial of its experimental COVID-19 vaccine after approval by regulators, and Johnson & Johnson (N: ) is preparing to resume its trial on Monday or Tuesday, the companies said on Friday.
 
 The news signaled progress against the novel coronavirus that has infected more than 41 million globally, including 8 million Americans and comes 10 days before a U.S. presidential election that may hinge on plans (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election/biden-warns-on-coronavirus-surge-trump-heads-to-florida-in-campaign-sprint-idUSKBN2781A4) to fight the pandemic.
 
 AstraZeneca, one of the leading vaccine developers, paused its U.S. trial on Sept. 6 after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company's UK trial. J&J paused its large, late-stage trial last week after a study participant became ill.
 
 Both companies have contracts to provide vaccine to the United States and other governments if they are cleared by regulators.
 
 Officials and experts have expressed concern that the regulatory approval process overseen by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be undermined by political pressure, and around a quarter of Americans say they are hesitant to take a COVID-19 vaccine.
 
 ""As this trial resumes, I am hoping the message communicated to the public is that we are following procedures to highest ethical standard and not interfering with the FDA regulatory process,"" said Matthew Hepburn, head of vaccine development for Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership to speed inoculation efforts.
 
 Infections are rising in 80 countries (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/index.html) as people in the northern hemisphere spend more time indoors with winter approaching.
 
 J&J said on Friday that the safety panel, called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board, has recommended that the drugmaker resume trial recruitment after finding no evidence that the vaccine caused the volunteer to fall ill.
 
 J&J expects to resume its trial in the United States on Monday or Tuesday and remains on track to produce data from the trial on the vaccines' effectiveness by the end of 2020 or early 2021, J&J's chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels said.
 
 J&J is also in discussions with other regulators to resume a trial outside of the United States, the company said.
 
 So far, the medical board has not identified a clear cause for the patients' illness. J&J cannot reveal any details about the patient's sickness because of patient privacy rules, Stoffels said.
 
 AstraZeneca said that it is not unusual for some trial participants to fall ill during large scale vaccine trials but that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reviewed all safety data from the trials globally and deemed it safe to continue testing the vaccine.
 
 AstraZeneca trials in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa resumed last month even as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continued its investigation into the case.
 
 Reuters earlier this week reported that the FDA had completed its review and that the AstraZeneca U.S. trial was set to resume as early as this week, citing four sources familiar with the situation.
